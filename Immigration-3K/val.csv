Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

The justice secretary has said he would be comfortable with severe punishment for immigration lawyers who engage in malpractice after the government said they could face life in jail under the terms of the Illegal Migration Act. But a senior official from the Law Society, the body that represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed out that a government taskforce being trumpeted by ministers on Tuesday in response to allegations of wrongdoing by some solicitors in dealing with asylum applications had already been working for months before the scandal. “The solicitors’ profession wants to see all of this eradicated. It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring, said David McNeill, the Law Society’s director of public affairs. McNeill spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after three legal firms were shut down over allegations false asylum claims were being submitted for a fee. He accepted such practice could go on in the industry but said: “This taskforce which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” The government’s approach to dealing with asylum claims has included requiring people to submit a claim while physically in the UK, while also shutting off all safe and legal routes to get there to the vast majority of people. Campaigners have argued this has pushed people to try to enter by irregular means, such as by crossing the Channel in small boats. ON TUESDAY, THE JUSTICE SECRETARY, ALEX CHALK, TOLD GB NEWS: “THERE’S BEEN LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR THOSE WHO AID AND ABET ILLEGAL MIGRATION FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND, YES, I’M ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE THAT THOSE WHO BREACH THEIR PROFESSIONAL DUTIES AND ACT ILLEGALLY SHOULD BE CONVICTED, PUNISHED AND DISGRACED. I’m entirely comfortable with that.” Chalk added: “Most lawyers do a fantastic job, but those that don’t, those that abuse their position and act illegally, it’s very important that the system comes down on that like a ton of bricks.” He also said the backlog of cases had decreased by 17,000 over recent weeks, after Home Office figures revealed more than 50,000 people were staying in hotels in June. On Sunday, the Independent reported that thousands of cases had simply been marked as cleared without the claimant having been assessed. The news site reported that Home Office guidance allowed officials to unilaterally close cases, even where they had not been able to contact the claimant, with a letter to them simply being filed away. It said many were closed because people did not attend interviews, quoting a Home Office official as saying: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down. A lot of interviews were booked to withdraw as many claims as possible [if people didn’t turn up].”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,0

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. DONALD TRUMP ROSE TO POWER, IN PART, BY DEMONISING MUSLIMS, BUT NO MINORITY IN THE US REPRESENTS ANY SORT OF THREAT TO A NOW EMBATTLED DEMOCRACY, UNLIKE THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT HE STIRRED UP. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated.

The New Conservatives group of backbenchers wants to reduce the number of study visas by around 75,000 by excluding the worst universities from eligibility. 1 Tory MPs say slashing immigration must not be compromised to prop up universities Credit: Alamy It is among 12 demands they are making to Rishi Sunak in a new report which they believe will reduce net migration by 400,000. Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”. Yesterday the 25-strong New Conservatives insisted they were not “rebels” and fully supported the PM.

She said: “Particularly in towns and cities, a huge volume of immigration over over the last 10 years particularly, those of course, change the culture in society very significantly.” Hitting back at critics, Mr Hunt said it was “disparaging to label people xenophobes” for voicing fears about migration.

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary. SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THE HOME SECRETARY, WANTS TO USE BARGES AND SITES INCLUDING CONVERTED MILITARY BASES TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REDUCE THE £6M DAILY COST OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WHILE PEOPLE AWAIT A DECISION ON THEIR STATUS. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels “as soon as possible”, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said around 1,700 asylum decisions are being made by the Home Office per week and it is on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed – five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall where it had been undergoing refurbishment work. The government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in the belief that it will deter up to 65,000 asylum seekers every year crossing the Channel in small boats. The policy was rejected by the courts last month. Braverman is challenging the decision in the supreme court.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers,0

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept. According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees The 53-year-old, who first hit the headlines when she had a relationship with a Tunisian migrant, quit Care4Calais this year amid allegations she had used pepper spray on a refugee in self-defence and threatened to drag a female volunteer out of a room 'by the f****** hair'. But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'ITS FUNDS WERE PUT AT RISK, AND THERE WAS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND/OR MISMANAGEMENT BY THE FORMER TRUSTEES.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'As with certain immigration lawyers, it's clear that some charities and civil society groups are actively undermining efforts to curb illegal migration. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets. I always followed the advice of our lawyers, accountants and auditors in the running of Care4Calais.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The Justice Secretary has defended the Government’s announcement of a “task force” for identifying corrupt immigration lawyers as critics branded it a “red herring” to distract from the asylum backlog. Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,,0

For instance, when a tragedy happens at sea.",2,"Universities are becoming primary victims of the chaos enveloping Britain’s public sector. News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. THIS FOLLOWS REPORTS THAT ONE-THIRD OF ENGLAND’S UNIVERSITIES ARE TRADING AT A DEFICIT. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm.

The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said. Labour would end the use of hotels and barges, “going back to the low-cost, long-standing asylum accommodation of which we have tens of thousands of places in this country”. But pressed on Labour’s asylum policy answer if the party is returned to power, Ms Cooper said: “We don’t know what the scale of the chaos is going to be.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230811083055/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,1

Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" as one of his five pledges to Britain after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of migrants in hotels after a record number arrived in Britain last year.

In 2021, the figure was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. A month ago, Rishi Sunak delivered a major speech, insisting small boat crossings were down 20 percent since he unveiled his illegal crossings plan five months earlier. However, he received criticism at the time as the fall had been caused by a windy first few months to 2023, which had driven crossings down. Mr Sunak boasted that his 'plan is working' Nigel Farage warned Mr Sunak that his hubris would be undermined when the wind dropped, and said the fact numbers of migrants were up in Europe should have been a cause for concern in Downing Stree.

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,1

Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary. SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THE HOME SECRETARY, WANTS TO USE BARGES AND SITES INCLUDING CONVERTED MILITARY BASES TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REDUCE THE £6M DAILY COST OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WHILE PEOPLE AWAIT A DECISION ON THEIR STATUS. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels “as soon as possible”, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said around 1,700 asylum decisions are being made by the Home Office per week and it is on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed – five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall where it had been undergoing refurbishment work. The government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in the belief that it will deter up to 65,000 asylum seekers every year crossing the Channel in small boats. The policy was rejected by the courts last month. Braverman is challenging the decision in the supreme court.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers,0

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept. According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees The 53-year-old, who first hit the headlines when she had a relationship with a Tunisian migrant, quit Care4Calais this year amid allegations she had used pepper spray on a refugee in self-defence and threatened to drag a female volunteer out of a room 'by the f****** hair'. But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'ITS FUNDS WERE PUT AT RISK, AND THERE WAS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND/OR MISMANAGEMENT BY THE FORMER TRUSTEES.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'As with certain immigration lawyers, it's clear that some charities and civil society groups are actively undermining efforts to curb illegal migration. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets. I always followed the advice of our lawyers, accountants and auditors in the running of Care4Calais.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. BUT SPEAKING ON SUNDAY, MR KINNOCK SAID: ""WE WILL BE FORCED TO USE THESE CONTINGENCY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE MESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,0

Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary. SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THE HOME SECRETARY, WANTS TO USE BARGES AND SITES INCLUDING CONVERTED MILITARY BASES TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REDUCE THE £6M DAILY COST OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WHILE PEOPLE AWAIT A DECISION ON THEIR STATUS. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels “as soon as possible”, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said around 1,700 asylum decisions are being made by the Home Office per week and it is on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed – five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall where it had been undergoing refurbishment work.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, Home Office figures show, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,,0

One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair?

The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable. And why it's so damaging when, as in the case of these lawyers, they don't.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. IT IS DISPARAGING TO LABEL PEOPLE AS XENOPHOBES FOR HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING NET MIGRATION AT HALF-A-MILLION A YEAR CONSERVATIVE MP TOM HUNT “I THINK IT IS WRONG TO BRAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NET MIGRATION BEING AT THE LEVEL IT IS RIGHT NOW AS SOMEHOW HOSTILE TO IMMIGRATION, WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, Home Office figures show, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,,0

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year. A Home Office spokesman said: “We will continue to strike the right balance between supporting the UK economy through skilled worker visas and upholding our commitment to reduce migration over time.”",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,0

Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party.

During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. IT IS DISPARAGING TO LABEL PEOPLE AS XENOPHOBES FOR HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING NET MIGRATION AT HALF-A-MILLION A YEAR CONSERVATIVE MP TOM HUNT “I THINK IT IS WRONG TO BRAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NET MIGRATION BEING AT THE LEVEL IT IS RIGHT NOW AS SOMEHOW HOSTILE TO IMMIGRATION, WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,0

The Home Office will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work. It comes after a number of construction roles were added to the 'shortage occupation list', following a recommendation by the body that advises ministers on migration issues. But the move risks angering Tory MPs as it comes just weeks after net migration to Britain was revealed to have reached record levels. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration - the number of arrivals to the UK minus the number of departures - rose to 606,000 in the year to December 2022. Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. DONALD TRUMP ROSE TO POWER, IN PART, BY DEMONISING MUSLIMS, BUT NO MINORITY IN THE US REPRESENTS ANY SORT OF THREAT TO A NOW EMBATTLED DEMOCRACY, UNLIKE THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT HE STIRRED UP. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} MPs who came up with a blueprint for reducing the number of migrants arriving lawfully into the UK have insisted they are loyal to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. IT IS DISPARAGING TO LABEL PEOPLE AS XENOPHOBES FOR HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING NET MIGRATION AT HALF-A-MILLION A YEAR CONSERVATIVE MP TOM HUNT “I THINK IT IS WRONG TO BRAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NET MIGRATION BEING AT THE LEVEL IT IS RIGHT NOW AS SOMEHOW HOSTILE TO IMMIGRATION, WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills.

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,1

Mr Sunak boasted that his 'plan is working' Nigel Farage warned Mr Sunak that his hubris would be undermined when the wind dropped, and said the fact numbers of migrants were up in Europe should have been a cause for concern in Downing Stree.

The letter, setting out new proposals on how to secure Britain’s borders, criticised the Tory record and observed “we are now very far from our pledge to get the numbers below 2019 level”.

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. THIS FOLLOWS REPORTS THAT ONE-THIRD OF ENGLAND’S UNIVERSITIES ARE TRADING AT A DEFICIT. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. BUT SPEAKING ON SUNDAY, MR KINNOCK SAID: ""WE WILL BE FORCED TO USE THESE CONTINGENCY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE MESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Meanwhile Home Secretary Suella Braverman attacked the legal profession in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, branding immigration lawyers ""criminals and conmen"" who should be in prison. ""These so-called immigration lawyers, who have been very powerfully exposed as being criminals and conmen, coaching migrants on how to lie to get through our system, how to game our system, how to play our rules, they are cheating the British people,"" said MsBraverman.

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. THIS FOLLOWS REPORTS THAT ONE-THIRD OF ENGLAND’S UNIVERSITIES ARE TRADING AT A DEFICIT. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

But he admitted that the Government has more to do to reduce the “vast expense” to taxpayers. The cost of the asylum system ballooned to £3.96billion from £2.11billion in a year as the total of migrants waiting for a decision rose to a record high. TORY MPS LAST NIGHT SAID THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS “NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE” AND URGED “ROOT AND BRANCH REFORM”. But the Prime Minister told the Daily Express: “The best way to relieve the unsustainable pressures on our asylum system and unacceptable costs to the taxpayer is to stop the boats in the first place. “That’s why we are focused on our plan to break the business model of the people smugglers facilitating these journeys, including working with international partners upstream to disrupt their efforts, stepping up joint work with the French to help reduce crossings and tackling the asylum backlog.

A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar.

Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair?

The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable. And why it's so damaging when, as in the case of these lawyers, they don't.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”.

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in Britain in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" as one of his five pledges to Britain after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of migrants in hotels after a record number arrived in Britain last year. ""IN THE FIVE MONTHS SINCE I LAUNCHED THE PLAN, CROSSINGS (ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL) ARE NOW DOWN 20% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR,"" SUNAK TOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. He also said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country. ""We've now returned 1,800 to Albania in just six months. We've gone from accepting around one in five Albanian asylum cases, to now just one in 50,"" Sunak said. ""So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%.""

For instance, when a tragedy happens at sea.",2,"The Home Office is paying for thousands of empty hotel beds reserved for people seeking asylum to avoid a repeat of dangerous overcrowding at a processing centre last year, MPs have heard. Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary. SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THE HOME SECRETARY, WANTS TO USE BARGES AND SITES INCLUDING CONVERTED MILITARY BASES TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REDUCE THE £6M DAILY COST OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WHILE PEOPLE AWAIT A DECISION ON THEIR STATUS. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels “as soon as possible”, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said around 1,700 asylum decisions are being made by the Home Office per week and it is on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed – five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall where it had been undergoing refurbishment work. The government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in the belief that it will deter up to 65,000 asylum seekers every year crossing the Channel in small boats. The policy was rejected by the courts last month.

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year.

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014.

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year.

Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary. SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THE HOME SECRETARY, WANTS TO USE BARGES AND SITES INCLUDING CONVERTED MILITARY BASES TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REDUCE THE £6M DAILY COST OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WHILE PEOPLE AWAIT A DECISION ON THEIR STATUS. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels “as soon as possible”, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said around 1,700 asylum decisions are being made by the Home Office per week and it is on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed – five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall where it had been undergoing refurbishment work. The government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in the belief that it will deter up to 65,000 asylum seekers every year crossing the Channel in small boats. The policy was rejected by the courts last month.

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. THIS FOLLOWS REPORTS THAT ONE-THIRD OF ENGLAND’S UNIVERSITIES ARE TRADING AT A DEFICIT. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

The New Conservatives group of backbenchers wants to reduce the number of study visas by around 75,000 by excluding the worst universities from eligibility. 1 Tory MPs say slashing immigration must not be compromised to prop up universities Credit: Alamy It is among 12 demands they are making to Rishi Sunak in a new report which they believe will reduce net migration by 400,000. Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”. Yesterday the 25-strong New Conservatives insisted they were not “rebels” and fully supported the PM. Tory Party deputy Lee Anderson fuelled speculation he had been reined in by No10 after pulling out of the event at the last minute - but later claimed to be sick.

She said: “Particularly in towns and cities, a huge volume of immigration over over the last 10 years particularly, those of course, change the culture in society very significantly.” Hitting back at critics, Mr Hunt said it was “disparaging to label people xenophobes” for voicing fears about migration.

Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014. These hikes are expected to be enforced from the beginning of next year, after the laws are altered this autumn. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said: “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue.” “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties,” he added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230807065633/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,0

But he admitted that the Government has more to do to reduce the “vast expense” to taxpayers. The cost of the asylum system ballooned to £3.96billion from £2.11billion in a year as the total of migrants waiting for a decision rose to a record high. TORY MPS LAST NIGHT SAID THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS “NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE” AND URGED “ROOT AND BRANCH REFORM”. But the Prime Minister told the Daily Express: “The best way to relieve the unsustainable pressures on our asylum system and unacceptable costs to the taxpayer is to stop the boats in the first place. “That’s why we are focused on our plan to break the business model of the people smugglers facilitating these journeys, including working with international partners upstream to disrupt their efforts, stepping up joint work with the French to help reduce crossings and tackling the asylum backlog. READ MORE Figures show asylum seekers applying to UK highest in two decades Rishi Sunak urges to stop the boats “We’ve already reduced the legacy backlog by over 28,000 – nearly a third – since the start of December and we remain on track to meet our target. “But we know there is more to do to make sure asylum seekers do not spend months or years – living in the UK at vast expense to the taxpayer – waiting for a decision.” Mr Sunak added: “That’s why we’ve doubled the number of caseworkers over the last two years and continue to recruit more, and we are streamlining and modernising the end-to-end process with improved guidance, more focused interviews and rolling out the use of digital technology.” The Home Office spent £3.97billion on the asylum system in 2022/23, up from £2.12billion in a year. A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants. Some 175,457 people were waiting on an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June – up 44% from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since 1999.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

A Home Office spokesman said the unit had already uncovered links between an immigration advice firm and 'one of the most wanted human traffickers'.

This could include, for example, patterns of similar claims being submitted for different migrants by the same firms. Evidence dossiers will be passed on to police or the National Crime Agency to launch prosecutions. In addition, there will be improved intelligence-sharing across a range of departments and quangos.

The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic.

CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels. It is right that we explore all available options. “CTM was awarded the contract to deliver accommodation for the Home Office after an extensive procurement process and has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation. “We are pleased that they will be providing management for Bibby Stockholm, the two additional vessels announced by the prime minister, as well as bridging accommodation and travel services.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20231107205558/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,0

The justice secretary has said he would be comfortable with severe punishment for immigration lawyers who engage in malpractice after the government said they could face life in jail under the terms of the Illegal Migration Act. But a senior official from the Law Society, the body that represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed out that a government taskforce being trumpeted by ministers on Tuesday in response to allegations of wrongdoing by some solicitors in dealing with asylum applications had already been working for months before the scandal. “The solicitors’ profession wants to see all of this eradicated. It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring, said David McNeill, the Law Society’s director of public affairs. McNeill spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after three legal firms were shut down over allegations false asylum claims were being submitted for a fee. He accepted such practice could go on in the industry but said: “This taskforce which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” The government’s approach to dealing with asylum claims has included requiring people to submit a claim while physically in the UK, while also shutting off all safe and legal routes to get there to the vast majority of people. Campaigners have argued this has pushed people to try to enter by irregular means, such as by crossing the Channel in small boats. ON TUESDAY, THE JUSTICE SECRETARY, ALEX CHALK, TOLD GB NEWS: “THERE’S BEEN LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR THOSE WHO AID AND ABET ILLEGAL MIGRATION FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND, YES, I’M ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE THAT THOSE WHO BREACH THEIR PROFESSIONAL DUTIES AND ACT ILLEGALLY SHOULD BE CONVICTED, PUNISHED AND DISGRACED. I’m entirely comfortable with that.” Chalk added: “Most lawyers do a fantastic job, but those that don’t, those that abuse their position and act illegally, it’s very important that the system comes down on that like a ton of bricks.” He also said the backlog of cases had decreased by 17,000 over recent weeks, after Home Office figures revealed more than 50,000 people were staying in hotels in June. On Sunday, the Independent reported that thousands of cases had simply been marked as cleared without the claimant having been assessed. The news site reported that Home Office guidance allowed officials to unilaterally close cases, even where they had not been able to contact the claimant, with a letter to them simply being filed away. It said many were closed because people did not attend interviews, quoting a Home Office official as saying: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down. A lot of interviews were booked to withdraw as many claims as possible [if people didn’t turn up].”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,0

In 2021, the figure was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. A month ago, Rishi Sunak delivered a major speech, insisting small boat crossings were down 20 percent since he unveiled his illegal crossings plan five months earlier. However, he received criticism at the time as the fall had been caused by a windy first few months to 2023, which had driven crossings down. Mr Sunak boasted that his 'plan is working' Nigel Farage warned Mr Sunak that his hubris would be undermined when the wind dropped, and said the fact numbers of migrants were up in Europe should have been a cause for concern in Downing Stree. The record-high June figures include 155 migrants who arrived in three boats on Friday. Records began five years ago.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The Justice Secretary has defended the Government’s announcement of a “task force” for identifying corrupt immigration lawyers as critics branded it a “red herring” to distract from the asylum backlog. Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions.

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,0

Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”. Yesterday the 25-strong New Conservatives insisted they were not “rebels” and fully supported the PM.

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

In 2021, the figure was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. A month ago, Rishi Sunak delivered a major speech, insisting small boat crossings were down 20 percent since he unveiled his illegal crossings plan five months earlier. However, he received criticism at the time as the fall had been caused by a windy first few months to 2023, which had driven crossings down. Mr Sunak boasted that his 'plan is working' Nigel Farage warned Mr Sunak that his hubris would be undermined when the wind dropped, and said the fact numbers of migrants were up in Europe should have been a cause for concern in Downing Stree. The record-high June figures include 155 migrants who arrived in three boats on Friday. Records began five years ago. Mr Sunak said stopping the boats was one of “the people’s priorities”, and vowed to “rebuild trust in politics through action, or not at all”.

Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014. These hikes are expected to be enforced from the beginning of next year, after the laws are altered this autumn. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said: “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue.” “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties,” he added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230807065633/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,0

Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,,0

A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,,0

A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. THIS FOLLOWS REPORTS THAT ONE-THIRD OF ENGLAND’S UNIVERSITIES ARE TRADING AT A DEFICIT. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching.

Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

CTM was later involved in operations to transport Afghans and Ukrainians to the UK, and operated two cruise ships used to temporarily house Ukrainian refugees in Scotland. That contract, which was also awarded without competition under the same framework as the new barges, covered two ships and hotels, and had an estimated value of £100m. CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels.

The justice secretary has said he would be comfortable with severe punishment for immigration lawyers who engage in malpractice after the government said they could face life in jail under the terms of the Illegal Migration Act. But a senior official from the Law Society, the body that represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed out that a government taskforce being trumpeted by ministers on Tuesday in response to allegations of wrongdoing by some solicitors in dealing with asylum applications had already been working for months before the scandal. “The solicitors’ profession wants to see all of this eradicated. It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring, said David McNeill, the Law Society’s director of public affairs. McNeill spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after three legal firms were shut down over allegations false asylum claims were being submitted for a fee. He accepted such practice could go on in the industry but said: “This taskforce which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” The government’s approach to dealing with asylum claims has included requiring people to submit a claim while physically in the UK, while also shutting off all safe and legal routes to get there to the vast majority of people. Campaigners have argued this has pushed people to try to enter by irregular means, such as by crossing the Channel in small boats. ON TUESDAY, THE JUSTICE SECRETARY, ALEX CHALK, TOLD GB NEWS: “THERE’S BEEN LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR THOSE WHO AID AND ABET ILLEGAL MIGRATION FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND, YES, I’M ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE THAT THOSE WHO BREACH THEIR PROFESSIONAL DUTIES AND ACT ILLEGALLY SHOULD BE CONVICTED, PUNISHED AND DISGRACED. I’m entirely comfortable with that.” Chalk added: “Most lawyers do a fantastic job, but those that don’t, those that abuse their position and act illegally, it’s very important that the system comes down on that like a ton of bricks.” He also said the backlog of cases had decreased by 17,000 over recent weeks, after Home Office figures revealed more than 50,000 people were staying in hotels in June. On Sunday, the Independent reported that thousands of cases had simply been marked as cleared without the claimant having been assessed. The news site reported that Home Office guidance allowed officials to unilaterally close cases, even where they had not been able to contact the claimant, with a letter to them simply being filed away. It said many were closed because people did not attend interviews, quoting a Home Office official as saying: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down. A lot of interviews were booked to withdraw as many claims as possible [if people didn’t turn up].”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,0

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. SOME UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING MANCHESTER, GLASGOW, SHEFFIELD, UCL AND IMPERIAL, RELY ON CHINESE STUDENTS ALONE FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept. According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees The 53-year-old, who first hit the headlines when she had a relationship with a Tunisian migrant, quit Care4Calais this year amid allegations she had used pepper spray on a refugee in self-defence and threatened to drag a female volunteer out of a room 'by the f****** hair'. But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'ITS FUNDS WERE PUT AT RISK, AND THERE WAS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND/OR MISMANAGEMENT BY THE FORMER TRUSTEES.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'As with certain immigration lawyers, it's clear that some charities and civil society groups are actively undermining efforts to curb illegal migration. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets. I always followed the advice of our lawyers, accountants and auditors in the running of Care4Calais.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

New analysis shows the Government gave nearly £1.5billion to groups opposing its efforts to end the small boat crossings. It comes as ministers vowed to fight a Court of Appeal ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Saturday night: “Despite this judgement, our commitment to stopping the boats is as strong as ever.” On Saturday night it emerged the Church of England has also attacked the Government’s immigration policies, by accusing Ministers of creating a “boom market” for people smugglers. READ MORE: Rishi Sunak threatens war with Lords over plot to block illegal migrant bill [LATEST] Rwanda scheme foiled by £1.5bn of taxpayer's money In a briefing paper for MPs, bishops said: “Fees to traffickers and smugglers are not simply paid up-front, but often include conditional labour, entrapment and exploitation in the UK to work off the debt incurred from being trafficked. In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. My message to readers is this: despite this judgment, our commitment to stopping the boats remains as strong as ever. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets.

""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year.

It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair?

The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable. And why it's so damaging when, as in the case of these lawyers, they don't.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

For instance, when a tragedy happens at sea.",2,"You can’t separate Britain’s parlous state and Rishi Sunak’s latest bungled attempt to escalate the “stop the boats” campaign. No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. DONALD TRUMP ROSE TO POWER, IN PART, BY DEMONISING MUSLIMS, BUT NO MINORITY IN THE US REPRESENTS ANY SORT OF THREAT TO A NOW EMBATTLED DEMOCRACY, UNLIKE THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT HE STIRRED UP. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept. According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees The 53-year-old, who first hit the headlines when she had a relationship with a Tunisian migrant, quit Care4Calais this year amid allegations she had used pepper spray on a refugee in self-defence and threatened to drag a female volunteer out of a room 'by the f****** hair'. But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'ITS FUNDS WERE PUT AT RISK, AND THERE WAS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND/OR MISMANAGEMENT BY THE FORMER TRUSTEES.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'As with certain immigration lawyers, it's clear that some charities and civil society groups are actively undermining efforts to curb illegal migration. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets.

New analysis shows the Government gave nearly £1.5billion to groups opposing its efforts to end the small boat crossings. It comes as ministers vowed to fight a Court of Appeal ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Saturday night: “Despite this judgement, our commitment to stopping the boats is as strong as ever.” On Saturday night it emerged the Church of England has also attacked the Government’s immigration policies, by accusing Ministers of creating a “boom market” for people smugglers. READ MORE: Rishi Sunak threatens war with Lords over plot to block illegal migrant bill [LATEST] Rwanda scheme foiled by £1.5bn of taxpayer's money In a briefing paper for MPs, bishops said: “Fees to traffickers and smugglers are not simply paid up-front, but often include conditional labour, entrapment and exploitation in the UK to work off the debt incurred from being trafficked. In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. My message to readers is this: despite this judgment, our commitment to stopping the boats remains as strong as ever. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

The New Conservatives group of backbenchers wants to reduce the number of study visas by around 75,000 by excluding the worst universities from eligibility. 1 Tory MPs say slashing immigration must not be compromised to prop up universities Credit: Alamy It is among 12 demands they are making to Rishi Sunak in a new report which they believe will reduce net migration by 400,000. Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} Ministers are reportedly reconsidering proposals to send migrants to British overseas territories if their Rwanda plan fails. Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent.

It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable.

TORY MPS LAST NIGHT SAID THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS “NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE” AND URGED “ROOT AND BRANCH REFORM”. But the Prime Minister told the Daily Express: “The best way to relieve the unsustainable pressures on our asylum system and unacceptable costs to the taxpayer is to stop the boats in the first place. “That’s why we are focused on our plan to break the business model of the people smugglers facilitating these journeys, including working with international partners upstream to disrupt their efforts, stepping up joint work with the French to help reduce crossings and tackling the asylum backlog.

A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants. Some 175,457 people were waiting on an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June – up 44% from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since 1999.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable. And why it's so damaging when, as in the case of these lawyers, they don't.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} Ministers are reportedly reconsidering proposals to send migrants to British overseas territories if their Rwanda plan fails. Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014. These hikes are expected to be enforced from the beginning of next year, after the laws are altered this autumn. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said: “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue.” “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties,” he added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230807065633/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,0

New analysis shows the Government gave nearly £1.5billion to groups opposing its efforts to end the small boat crossings. It comes as ministers vowed to fight a Court of Appeal ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Saturday night: “Despite this judgement, our commitment to stopping the boats is as strong as ever.” On Saturday night it emerged the Church of England has also attacked the Government’s immigration policies, by accusing Ministers of creating a “boom market” for people smugglers. READ MORE: Rishi Sunak threatens war with Lords over plot to block illegal migrant bill [LATEST] Rwanda scheme foiled by £1.5bn of taxpayer's money In a briefing paper for MPs, bishops said: “Fees to traffickers and smugglers are not simply paid up-front, but often include conditional labour, entrapment and exploitation in the UK to work off the debt incurred from being trafficked. In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. My message to readers is this: despite this judgment, our commitment to stopping the boats remains as strong as ever. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,,0

Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

CTM was later involved in operations to transport Afghans and Ukrainians to the UK, and operated two cruise ships used to temporarily house Ukrainian refugees in Scotland. That contract, which was also awarded without competition under the same framework as the new barges, covered two ships and hotels, and had an estimated value of £100m. CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels. It is right that we explore all available options. “CTM was awarded the contract to deliver accommodation for the Home Office after an extensive procurement process and has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation. “We are pleased that they will be providing management for Bibby Stockholm, the two additional vessels announced by the prime minister, as well as bridging accommodation and travel services.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20231107205558/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, Home Office figures show, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,,0

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm. But Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the barge as “a sign of failure” by the Government, noting that 10,000 more asylum claimants have been moved into hotels since Rishi Sunak vowed to “stop the boats” coming across the Channel as one of five pledges the Prime Minister made in January. The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

CTM was later involved in operations to transport Afghans and Ukrainians to the UK, and operated two cruise ships used to temporarily house Ukrainian refugees in Scotland. That contract, which was also awarded without competition under the same framework as the new barges, covered two ships and hotels, and had an estimated value of £100m. CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels. It is right that we explore all available options. “CTM was awarded the contract to deliver accommodation for the Home Office after an extensive procurement process and has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation. “We are pleased that they will be providing management for Bibby Stockholm, the two additional vessels announced by the prime minister, as well as bridging accommodation and travel services.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20231107205558/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, Home Office figures show, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,,1

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

New analysis shows the Government gave nearly £1.5billion to groups opposing its efforts to end the small boat crossings. It comes as ministers vowed to fight a Court of Appeal ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Saturday night: “Despite this judgement, our commitment to stopping the boats is as strong as ever.” On Saturday night it emerged the Church of England has also attacked the Government’s immigration policies, by accusing Ministers of creating a “boom market” for people smugglers. READ MORE: Rishi Sunak threatens war with Lords over plot to block illegal migrant bill [LATEST] Rwanda scheme foiled by £1.5bn of taxpayer's money In a briefing paper for MPs, bishops said: “Fees to traffickers and smugglers are not simply paid up-front, but often include conditional labour, entrapment and exploitation in the UK to work off the debt incurred from being trafficked. In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. My message to readers is this: despite this judgment, our commitment to stopping the boats remains as strong as ever. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept. According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees The 53-year-old, who first hit the headlines when she had a relationship with a Tunisian migrant, quit Care4Calais this year amid allegations she had used pepper spray on a refugee in self-defence and threatened to drag a female volunteer out of a room 'by the f****** hair'. But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'ITS FUNDS WERE PUT AT RISK, AND THERE WAS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND/OR MISMANAGEMENT BY THE FORMER TRUSTEES.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'As with certain immigration lawyers, it's clear that some charities and civil society groups are actively undermining efforts to curb illegal migration. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets. I always followed the advice of our lawyers, accountants and auditors in the running of Care4Calais.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in Britain in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" as one of his five pledges to Britain after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of migrants in hotels after a record number arrived in Britain last year. ""IN THE FIVE MONTHS SINCE I LAUNCHED THE PLAN, CROSSINGS (ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL) ARE NOW DOWN 20% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR,"" SUNAK TOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND.

He also said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country. ""We've now returned 1,800 to Albania in just six months. We've gone from accepting around one in five Albanian asylum cases, to now just one in 50,"" Sunak said. ""So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%.""

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. RATIONAL, FACTUALLY GROUNDED FEARS SHOULDN’T BE DIRECTED AT MIGRANTS AND MINORITIES, BUT AT POLITICIANS WHO SEEK TO GAIN POWER BY BLAMING THEM FOR THE ILLS AND INJUSTICES THEY CAUSED. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. BUT SPEAKING ON SUNDAY, MR KINNOCK SAID: ""WE WILL BE FORCED TO USE THESE CONTINGENCY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE MESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses.

For instance, when a tragedy happens at sea.",2,"Universities are becoming primary victims of the chaos enveloping Britain’s public sector. News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. SOME UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING MANCHESTER, GLASGOW, SHEFFIELD, UCL AND IMPERIAL, RELY ON CHINESE STUDENTS ALONE FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, Home Office figures show, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,,1

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,0

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran.

The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014. These hikes are expected to be enforced from the beginning of next year, after the laws are altered this autumn. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said: “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue.” “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties,” he added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230807065633/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,0

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year. A Home Office spokesman said: “We will continue to strike the right balance between supporting the UK economy through skilled worker visas and upholding our commitment to reduce migration over time.”",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,0

The fact-checking organisation Full Fact has obtained new freedom of information data which shows that between 1 January and 7 November 2022 only around 1% of all males arriving on small boats at Western Jet Foil claimed to be under 18 but were then later found to be over 18. Full Fact has written to Robert Jenrick asking him to correct the parliamentary record or to provide data which supports his claim. LAST NOVEMBER, JENRICK SAID IN PARLIAMENT: “AT TIMES, UP TO 20% OF THE ADULT MALES WHO ARRIVE AT WESTERN JET FOIL CLAIM TO BE UNDER 18, WHEN CLEARLY THE NUMBER IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT.” AN INITIAL REQUEST FULL FACT MADE TO JENRICK LAST NOVEMBER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE 20% CLAIM OR TO CORRECT THE PARLIAMENTARY RECORD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINISTERIAL CODE WENT UNANSWERED.

However, when Labour left power in 2010 the backlog was 18,954 and at the end of December 2022 it stood at 161,000.

I know our teams are working incredibly hard to root out those who game our asylum system and cheat the British public – this can't go on.' The taskforce has been secretly working for months but its existence was officially confirmed only today. A Home Office spokesman said the unit had already uncovered links between an immigration advice firm and 'one of the most wanted human traffickers'. Details of the case have been referred to the police, he added.

In future, it will widen its scope to investigate doctors, accountants and employers who conspire to aid illegal migrants. Those found guilty of fraud could face life imprisonment. The Professional Enablers Taskforce will train frontline immigration staff to identify and report 'suspect activity'. This could include, for example, patterns of similar claims being submitted for different migrants by the same firms. Evidence dossiers will be passed on to police or the National Crime Agency to launch prosecutions. In addition, there will be improved intelligence-sharing across a range of departments and quangos. Mrs Braverman will today chair a meeting with her Cabinet colleague Alex Chalk, the Solicitors Regulation Authority watchdog and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner to herald the new crackdown.

'This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.' The Mail's investigation led to the SRA suspending three legal firms caught offering to lodge fake asylum applications. The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Two said they would falsely claim that the undercover reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers.

The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country.

This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

The justice secretary has said he would be comfortable with severe punishment for immigration lawyers who engage in malpractice after the government said they could face life in jail under the terms of the Illegal Migration Act. But a senior official from the Law Society, the body that represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed out that a government taskforce being trumpeted by ministers on Tuesday in response to allegations of wrongdoing by some solicitors in dealing with asylum applications had already been working for months before the scandal. “The solicitors’ profession wants to see all of this eradicated. It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring, said David McNeill, the Law Society’s director of public affairs. McNeill spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after three legal firms were shut down over allegations false asylum claims were being submitted for a fee. He accepted such practice could go on in the industry but said: “This taskforce which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” The government’s approach to dealing with asylum claims has included requiring people to submit a claim while physically in the UK, while also shutting off all safe and legal routes to get there to the vast majority of people. Campaigners have argued this has pushed people to try to enter by irregular means, such as by crossing the Channel in small boats.

I’m entirely comfortable with that.” Chalk added: “Most lawyers do a fantastic job, but those that don’t, those that abuse their position and act illegally, it’s very important that the system comes down on that like a ton of bricks.” He also said the backlog of cases had decreased by 17,000 over recent weeks, after Home Office figures revealed more than 50,000 people were staying in hotels in June. On Sunday, the Independent reported that thousands of cases had simply been marked as cleared without the claimant having been assessed. The news site reported that Home Office guidance allowed officials to unilaterally close cases, even where they had not been able to contact the claimant, with a letter to them simply being filed away. It said many were closed because people did not attend interviews, quoting a Home Office official as saying: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down. A lot of interviews were booked to withdraw as many claims as possible [if people didn’t turn up].”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,0

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. IT IS DISPARAGING TO LABEL PEOPLE AS XENOPHOBES FOR HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING NET MIGRATION AT HALF-A-MILLION A YEAR CONSERVATIVE MP TOM HUNT “I THINK IT IS WRONG TO BRAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NET MIGRATION BEING AT THE LEVEL IT IS RIGHT NOW AS SOMEHOW HOSTILE TO IMMIGRATION, WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, Home Office figures show, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,,0

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm. But Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the barge as “a sign of failure” by the Government, noting that 10,000 more asylum claimants have been moved into hotels since Rishi Sunak vowed to “stop the boats” coming across the Channel as one of five pledges the Prime Minister made in January. The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said.

But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. IT IS DISPARAGING TO LABEL PEOPLE AS XENOPHOBES FOR HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING NET MIGRATION AT HALF-A-MILLION A YEAR CONSERVATIVE MP TOM HUNT “I THINK IT IS WRONG TO BRAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NET MIGRATION BEING AT THE LEVEL IT IS RIGHT NOW AS SOMEHOW HOSTILE TO IMMIGRATION, WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,1

The Home Office will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work. It comes after a number of construction roles were added to the 'shortage occupation list', following a recommendation by the body that advises ministers on migration issues. But the move risks angering Tory MPs as it comes just weeks after net migration to Britain was revealed to have reached record levels. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration - the number of arrivals to the UK minus the number of departures - rose to 606,000 in the year to December 2022. Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. RATIONAL, FACTUALLY GROUNDED FEARS SHOULDN’T BE DIRECTED AT MIGRANTS AND MINORITIES, BUT AT POLITICIANS WHO SEEK TO GAIN POWER BY BLAMING THEM FOR THE ILLS AND INJUSTICES THEY CAUSED. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated.

One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair?

The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision.

We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais. A total of 19,174 asylum seekers crossed the Channel this year",https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1805833/rishi-sunak-asylum-bill-billions-taxpayers-migrant-crisis,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1805833/rishi-sunak-asylum-bill-billions-taxpayers-migrant-crisis,1

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. IT IS DISPARAGING TO LABEL PEOPLE AS XENOPHOBES FOR HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING NET MIGRATION AT HALF-A-MILLION A YEAR CONSERVATIVE MP TOM HUNT “I THINK IT IS WRONG TO BRAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NET MIGRATION BEING AT THE LEVEL IT IS RIGHT NOW AS SOMEHOW HOSTILE TO IMMIGRATION, WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,0

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. SOME UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING MANCHESTER, GLASGOW, SHEFFIELD, UCL AND IMPERIAL, RELY ON CHINESE STUDENTS ALONE FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The Justice Secretary has defended the Government’s announcement of a “task force” for identifying corrupt immigration lawyers as critics branded it a “red herring” to distract from the asylum backlog. Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,,0

Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary. SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THE HOME SECRETARY, WANTS TO USE BARGES AND SITES INCLUDING CONVERTED MILITARY BASES TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REDUCE THE £6M DAILY COST OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WHILE PEOPLE AWAIT A DECISION ON THEIR STATUS. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels “as soon as possible”, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said around 1,700 asylum decisions are being made by the Home Office per week and it is on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed – five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall where it had been undergoing refurbishment work. The government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in the belief that it will deter up to 65,000 asylum seekers every year crossing the Channel in small boats. The policy was rejected by the courts last month.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. DONALD TRUMP ROSE TO POWER, IN PART, BY DEMONISING MUSLIMS, BUT NO MINORITY IN THE US REPRESENTS ANY SORT OF THREAT TO A NOW EMBATTLED DEMOCRACY, UNLIKE THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT HE STIRRED UP. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in Britain in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" as one of his five pledges to Britain after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of migrants in hotels after a record number arrived in Britain last year. ""IN THE FIVE MONTHS SINCE I LAUNCHED THE PLAN, CROSSINGS (ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL) ARE NOW DOWN 20% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR,"" SUNAK TOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. He also said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country. ""We've now returned 1,800 to Albania in just six months. We've gone from accepting around one in five Albanian asylum cases, to now just one in 50,"" Sunak said. ""So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%.""

Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014. These hikes are expected to be enforced from the beginning of next year, after the laws are altered this autumn. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said: “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue.” “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties,” he added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230807065633/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,0

In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. My message to readers is this: despite this judgment, our commitment to stopping the boats remains as strong as ever. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year. A Home Office spokesman said: “We will continue to strike the right balance between supporting the UK economy through skilled worker visas and upholding our commitment to reduce migration over time.”",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,0

He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. My message to readers is this: despite this judgment, our commitment to stopping the boats remains as strong as ever. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary.

He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions.

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. BUT SPEAKING ON SUNDAY, MR KINNOCK SAID: ""WE WILL BE FORCED TO USE THESE CONTINGENCY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE MESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

The fact-checking organisation Full Fact has obtained new freedom of information data which shows that between 1 January and 7 November 2022 only around 1% of all males arriving on small boats at Western Jet Foil claimed to be under 18 but were then later found to be over 18. Full Fact has written to Robert Jenrick asking him to correct the parliamentary record or to provide data which supports his claim. LAST NOVEMBER, JENRICK SAID IN PARLIAMENT: “AT TIMES, UP TO 20% OF THE ADULT MALES WHO ARRIVE AT WESTERN JET FOIL CLAIM TO BE UNDER 18, WHEN CLEARLY THE NUMBER IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT.” AN INITIAL REQUEST FULL FACT MADE TO JENRICK LAST NOVEMBER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE 20% CLAIM OR TO CORRECT THE PARLIAMENTARY RECORD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINISTERIAL CODE WENT UNANSWERED. The organisation then submitted a freedom of information request and received the data after several months of delay by the Home Office. It is not the first time Full Fact has raised concerns about the government’s use of immigration statistics. On 7 March 2023, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, accused Labour of leaving a far bigger asylum backlog than the government is currently dealing with. However, when Labour left power in 2010 the backlog was 18,954 and at the end of December 2022 it stood at 161,000. Full Fact raised concerns with the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) about ministers’ use of unpublished data and on 21 November the OSR’s director general, Ed Humpherson, wrote to Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary for the Home Office, to highlight the importance of transparency of statistics. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the job of the prime minister, the home secretary, and the minister for immigration to communicate accurately and responsibly with the public on important issues. “Repeated failure to be transparent makes proper democratic scrutiny impossible. It’s vital we’re all given access to the information behind the claims made by ministers when they make them, and that any data quoted publicly is freely available. Public trust in politics is low.

But he admitted that the Government has more to do to reduce the “vast expense” to taxpayers. The cost of the asylum system ballooned to £3.96billion from £2.11billion in a year as the total of migrants waiting for a decision rose to a record high. TORY MPS LAST NIGHT SAID THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS “NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE” AND URGED “ROOT AND BRANCH REFORM”. But the Prime Minister told the Daily Express: “The best way to relieve the unsustainable pressures on our asylum system and unacceptable costs to the taxpayer is to stop the boats in the first place. “That’s why we are focused on our plan to break the business model of the people smugglers facilitating these journeys, including working with international partners upstream to disrupt their efforts, stepping up joint work with the French to help reduce crossings and tackling the asylum backlog. READ MORE Figures show asylum seekers applying to UK highest in two decades Rishi Sunak urges to stop the boats “We’ve already reduced the legacy backlog by over 28,000 – nearly a third – since the start of December and we remain on track to meet our target. “But we know there is more to do to make sure asylum seekers do not spend months or years – living in the UK at vast expense to the taxpayer – waiting for a decision.” Mr Sunak added: “That’s why we’ve doubled the number of caseworkers over the last two years and continue to recruit more, and we are streamlining and modernising the end-to-end process with improved guidance, more focused interviews and rolling out the use of digital technology.” The Home Office spent £3.97billion on the asylum system in 2022/23, up from £2.12billion in a year. A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants. Some 175,457 people were waiting on an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June – up 44% from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since 1999.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,0

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

A Home Office spokesman said the unit had already uncovered links between an immigration advice firm and 'one of the most wanted human traffickers'. Details of the case have been referred to the police, he added.

'This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.' The Mail's investigation led to the SRA suspending three legal firms caught offering to lodge fake asylum applications. The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Two said they would falsely claim that the undercover reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. RATIONAL, FACTUALLY GROUNDED FEARS SHOULDN’T BE DIRECTED AT MIGRANTS AND MINORITIES, BUT AT POLITICIANS WHO SEEK TO GAIN POWER BY BLAMING THEM FOR THE ILLS AND INJUSTICES THEY CAUSED. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm.

The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said. Labour would end the use of hotels and barges, “going back to the low-cost, long-standing asylum accommodation of which we have tens of thousands of places in this country”.

I know our teams are working incredibly hard to root out those who game our asylum system and cheat the British public – this can't go on.' The taskforce has been secretly working for months but its existence was officially confirmed only today. A Home Office spokesman said the unit had already uncovered links between an immigration advice firm and 'one of the most wanted human traffickers'. Details of the case have been referred to the police, he added. The taskforce brings together watchdogs, legal industry bodies, government departments and law enforcement to gather stronger evidence against dodgy lawyers. In future, it will widen its scope to investigate doctors, accountants and employers who conspire to aid illegal migrants. Those found guilty of fraud could face life imprisonment. The Professional Enablers Taskforce will train frontline immigration staff to identify and report 'suspect activity'. This could include, for example, patterns of similar claims being submitted for different migrants by the same firms. Evidence dossiers will be passed on to police or the National Crime Agency to launch prosecutions. In addition, there will be improved intelligence-sharing across a range of departments and quangos. Mrs Braverman will today chair a meeting with her Cabinet colleague Alex Chalk, the Solicitors Regulation Authority watchdog and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner to herald the new crackdown. MRS BRAVERMAN WILL TODAY CHAIR A MEETING WITH HER CABINET COLLEAGUE ALEX CHALK (PICTURED), THE SOLICITORS REGULATION AUTHORITY WATCHDOG AND THE OFFICE OF THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES COMMISSIONER TO HERALD THE NEW CRACKDOWN MR CHALK, WHO IS THE LORD CHANCELLOR AND JUSTICE SECRETARY, SAID: 'THE ACCURACY AND HONESTY OF LEGAL ADVICE UNDERPINS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR WORLD-LEADING LEGAL SYSTEM, SO THOSE WHO UNDERMINE IT BY ENCOURAGING DECEPTION MUST BE HELD TO ACCOUNT. 'This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.' The Mail's investigation led to the SRA suspending three legal firms caught offering to lodge fake asylum applications. The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Two said they would falsely claim that the undercover reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers.

The justice secretary has said he would be comfortable with severe punishment for immigration lawyers who engage in malpractice after the government said they could face life in jail under the terms of the Illegal Migration Act. But a senior official from the Law Society, the body that represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed out that a government taskforce being trumpeted by ministers on Tuesday in response to allegations of wrongdoing by some solicitors in dealing with asylum applications had already been working for months before the scandal. “The solicitors’ profession wants to see all of this eradicated. It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring, said David McNeill, the Law Society’s director of public affairs. McNeill spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after three legal firms were shut down over allegations false asylum claims were being submitted for a fee. He accepted such practice could go on in the industry but said: “This taskforce which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” The government’s approach to dealing with asylum claims has included requiring people to submit a claim while physically in the UK, while also shutting off all safe and legal routes to get there to the vast majority of people. Campaigners have argued this has pushed people to try to enter by irregular means, such as by crossing the Channel in small boats.

I’m entirely comfortable with that.” Chalk added: “Most lawyers do a fantastic job, but those that don’t, those that abuse their position and act illegally, it’s very important that the system comes down on that like a ton of bricks.” He also said the backlog of cases had decreased by 17,000 over recent weeks, after Home Office figures revealed more than 50,000 people were staying in hotels in June. On Sunday, the Independent reported that thousands of cases had simply been marked as cleared without the claimant having been assessed. The news site reported that Home Office guidance allowed officials to unilaterally close cases, even where they had not been able to contact the claimant, with a letter to them simply being filed away. It said many were closed because people did not attend interviews, quoting a Home Office official as saying: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down. A lot of interviews were booked to withdraw as many claims as possible [if people didn’t turn up].”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,0

Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014. These hikes are expected to be enforced from the beginning of next year, after the laws are altered this autumn. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said: “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue.” “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties,” he added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230807065633/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,1

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm.

The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said. Labour would end the use of hotels and barges, “going back to the low-cost, long-standing asylum accommodation of which we have tens of thousands of places in this country”. But pressed on Labour’s asylum policy answer if the party is returned to power, Ms Cooper said: “We don’t know what the scale of the chaos is going to be.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230811083055/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,0

One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair?

The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable.

The Home Office will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work. It comes after a number of construction roles were added to the 'shortage occupation list', following a recommendation by the body that advises ministers on migration issues. But the move risks angering Tory MPs as it comes just weeks after net migration to Britain was revealed to have reached record levels. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration - the number of arrivals to the UK minus the number of departures - rose to 606,000 in the year to December 2022. Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

But he admitted that the Government has more to do to reduce the “vast expense” to taxpayers.

TORY MPS LAST NIGHT SAID THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS “NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE” AND URGED “ROOT AND BRANCH REFORM”. But the Prime Minister told the Daily Express: “The best way to relieve the unsustainable pressures on our asylum system and unacceptable costs to the taxpayer is to stop the boats in the first place. “That’s why we are focused on our plan to break the business model of the people smugglers facilitating these journeys, including working with international partners upstream to disrupt their efforts, stepping up joint work with the French to help reduce crossings and tackling the asylum backlog.

A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants. Some 175,457 people were waiting on an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June – up 44% from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since 1999.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. DONALD TRUMP ROSE TO POWER, IN PART, BY DEMONISING MUSLIMS, BUT NO MINORITY IN THE US REPRESENTS ANY SORT OF THREAT TO A NOW EMBATTLED DEMOCRACY, UNLIKE THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT HE STIRRED UP. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,,1

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels.""

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept. According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees The 53-year-old, who first hit the headlines when she had a relationship with a Tunisian migrant, quit Care4Calais this year amid allegations she had used pepper spray on a refugee in self-defence and threatened to drag a female volunteer out of a room 'by the f****** hair'. But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'ITS FUNDS WERE PUT AT RISK, AND THERE WAS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND/OR MISMANAGEMENT BY THE FORMER TRUSTEES.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'As with certain immigration lawyers, it's clear that some charities and civil society groups are actively undermining efforts to curb illegal migration. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets. I always followed the advice of our lawyers, accountants and auditors in the running of Care4Calais.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" as one of his five pledges to Britain after he was propelled to power in October last year.

The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”. Yesterday the 25-strong New Conservatives insisted they were not “rebels” and fully supported the PM. Tory Party deputy Lee Anderson fuelled speculation he had been reined in by No10 after pulling out of the event at the last minute - but later claimed to be sick. But the caucus warned Mr Sunak would lose the next election if he “kicked the can” of immigration down the road. Red Wall MP Miriam Cates said failing to keep numbers down “raises deep concerns about national and cultural security”. She said: “Particularly in towns and cities, a huge volume of immigration over over the last 10 years particularly, those of course, change the culture in society very significantly.” Hitting back at critics, Mr Hunt said it was “disparaging to label people xenophobes” for voicing fears about migration. Bury MP James Daly said immigration is the biggest issue to his voters “by a million miles”. AND DANNY KRUGER SAID HIS CABAL WERE RALLYING AGAINST THE “ESTABLISHMENT” ON MIGRATION REFORMS. The PM’s spokesman said: “We have to strike the right balance between tackling net migration and ensuring we have the right style to match the needs of the public.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/,http://web.archive.org/web/20230711205606/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/,0

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,0

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year. A Home Office spokesman said: “We will continue to strike the right balance between supporting the UK economy through skilled worker visas and upholding our commitment to reduce migration over time.”",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,1

He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

CTM was later involved in operations to transport Afghans and Ukrainians to the UK, and operated two cruise ships used to temporarily house Ukrainian refugees in Scotland. That contract, which was also awarded without competition under the same framework as the new barges, covered two ships and hotels, and had an estimated value of £100m. CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels. It is right that we explore all available options. “CTM was awarded the contract to deliver accommodation for the Home Office after an extensive procurement process and has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation. “We are pleased that they will be providing management for Bibby Stockholm, the two additional vessels announced by the prime minister, as well as bridging accommodation and travel services.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20231107205558/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,0

Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary. SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THE HOME SECRETARY, WANTS TO USE BARGES AND SITES INCLUDING CONVERTED MILITARY BASES TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REDUCE THE £6M DAILY COST OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WHILE PEOPLE AWAIT A DECISION ON THEIR STATUS. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels “as soon as possible”, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said around 1,700 asylum decisions are being made by the Home Office per week and it is on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed – five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall where it had been undergoing refurbishment work. The government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in the belief that it will deter up to 65,000 asylum seekers every year crossing the Channel in small boats. The policy was rejected by the courts last month. Braverman is challenging the decision in the supreme court.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers,0

One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair?

The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable.

Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971.

This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,,1

One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair? READ MORE: The cynical story spun by a legal advisor to undercover reporters posing as an economic migrant who arrived on a small boat to help them beat the system Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/debate/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_2 - -> The answer is simple. The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad.

NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,,0

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. SOME UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING MANCHESTER, GLASGOW, SHEFFIELD, UCL AND IMPERIAL, RELY ON CHINESE STUDENTS ALONE FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

A Home Office spokesman said the unit had already uncovered links between an immigration advice firm and 'one of the most wanted human traffickers'.

Evidence dossiers will be passed on to police or the National Crime Agency to launch prosecutions. In addition, there will be improved intelligence-sharing across a range of departments and quangos.

'This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.' The Mail's investigation led to the SRA suspending three legal firms caught offering to lodge fake asylum applications. The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Two said they would falsely claim that the undercover reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

That contract, which was also awarded without competition under the same framework as the new barges, covered two ships and hotels, and had an estimated value of £100m. CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels. It is right that we explore all available options. “CTM was awarded the contract to deliver accommodation for the Home Office after an extensive procurement process and has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation. “We are pleased that they will be providing management for Bibby Stockholm, the two additional vessels announced by the prime minister, as well as bridging accommodation and travel services.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20231107205558/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,0

New analysis shows the Government gave nearly £1.5billion to groups opposing its efforts to end the small boat crossings. It comes as ministers vowed to fight a Court of Appeal ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Saturday night: “Despite this judgement, our commitment to stopping the boats is as strong as ever.” On Saturday night it emerged the Church of England has also attacked the Government’s immigration policies, by accusing Ministers of creating a “boom market” for people smugglers. READ MORE: Rishi Sunak threatens war with Lords over plot to block illegal migrant bill [LATEST] Rwanda scheme foiled by £1.5bn of taxpayer's money In a briefing paper for MPs, bishops said: “Fees to traffickers and smugglers are not simply paid up-front, but often include conditional labour, entrapment and exploitation in the UK to work off the debt incurred from being trafficked. In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. My message to readers is this: despite this judgment, our commitment to stopping the boats remains as strong as ever. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place.

Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up.

A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France.

Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in Britain in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" as one of his five pledges to Britain after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of migrants in hotels after a record number arrived in Britain last year.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place.

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept. According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees The 53-year-old, who first hit the headlines when she had a relationship with a Tunisian migrant, quit Care4Calais this year amid allegations she had used pepper spray on a refugee in self-defence and threatened to drag a female volunteer out of a room 'by the f****** hair'. But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'ITS FUNDS WERE PUT AT RISK, AND THERE WAS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND/OR MISMANAGEMENT BY THE FORMER TRUSTEES.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'As with certain immigration lawyers, it's clear that some charities and civil society groups are actively undermining efforts to curb illegal migration. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets.

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. SOME UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING MANCHESTER, GLASGOW, SHEFFIELD, UCL AND IMPERIAL, RELY ON CHINESE STUDENTS ALONE FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

The Home Office will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work. It comes after a number of construction roles were added to the 'shortage occupation list', following a recommendation by the body that advises ministers on migration issues. But the move risks angering Tory MPs as it comes just weeks after net migration to Britain was revealed to have reached record levels. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration - the number of arrivals to the UK minus the number of departures - rose to 606,000 in the year to December 2022. Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

The justice secretary has said he would be comfortable with severe punishment for immigration lawyers who engage in malpractice after the government said they could face life in jail under the terms of the Illegal Migration Act. But a senior official from the Law Society, the body that represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed out that a government taskforce being trumpeted by ministers on Tuesday in response to allegations of wrongdoing by some solicitors in dealing with asylum applications had already been working for months before the scandal. “The solicitors’ profession wants to see all of this eradicated. It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring, said David McNeill, the Law Society’s director of public affairs. McNeill spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after three legal firms were shut down over allegations false asylum claims were being submitted for a fee. He accepted such practice could go on in the industry but said: “This taskforce which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” The government’s approach to dealing with asylum claims has included requiring people to submit a claim while physically in the UK, while also shutting off all safe and legal routes to get there to the vast majority of people. Campaigners have argued this has pushed people to try to enter by irregular means, such as by crossing the Channel in small boats.

I’m entirely comfortable with that.” Chalk added: “Most lawyers do a fantastic job, but those that don’t, those that abuse their position and act illegally, it’s very important that the system comes down on that like a ton of bricks.” He also said the backlog of cases had decreased by 17,000 over recent weeks, after Home Office figures revealed more than 50,000 people were staying in hotels in June. On Sunday, the Independent reported that thousands of cases had simply been marked as cleared without the claimant having been assessed. The news site reported that Home Office guidance allowed officials to unilaterally close cases, even where they had not been able to contact the claimant, with a letter to them simply being filed away. It said many were closed because people did not attend interviews, quoting a Home Office official as saying: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down.

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,0

The Home Office will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work. It comes after a number of construction roles were added to the 'shortage occupation list', following a recommendation by the body that advises ministers on migration issues. But the move risks angering Tory MPs as it comes just weeks after net migration to Britain was revealed to have reached record levels. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration - the number of arrivals to the UK minus the number of departures - rose to 606,000 in the year to December 2022. Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. THIS FOLLOWS REPORTS THAT ONE-THIRD OF ENGLAND’S UNIVERSITIES ARE TRADING AT A DEFICIT. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

New analysis shows the Government gave nearly £1.5billion to groups opposing its efforts to end the small boat crossings. It comes as ministers vowed to fight a Court of Appeal ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Saturday night: “Despite this judgement, our commitment to stopping the boats is as strong as ever.” On Saturday night it emerged the Church of England has also attacked the Government’s immigration policies, by accusing Ministers of creating a “boom market” for people smugglers. READ MORE: Rishi Sunak threatens war with Lords over plot to block illegal migrant bill [LATEST] Rwanda scheme foiled by £1.5bn of taxpayer's money In a briefing paper for MPs, bishops said: “Fees to traffickers and smugglers are not simply paid up-front, but often include conditional labour, entrapment and exploitation in the UK to work off the debt incurred from being trafficked. In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. My message to readers is this: despite this judgment, our commitment to stopping the boats remains as strong as ever. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

In 2021, the figure was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. A month ago, Rishi Sunak delivered a major speech, insisting small boat crossings were down 20 percent since he unveiled his illegal crossings plan five months earlier.

Writing to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Mr Chalk said: ""Solicitors are critical to the operation of a fair immigration system.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The Justice Secretary has defended the Government’s announcement of a “task force” for identifying corrupt immigration lawyers as critics branded it a “red herring” to distract from the asylum backlog. Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,,0

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. DONALD TRUMP ROSE TO POWER, IN PART, BY DEMONISING MUSLIMS, BUT NO MINORITY IN THE US REPRESENTS ANY SORT OF THREAT TO A NOW EMBATTLED DEMOCRACY, UNLIKE THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT HE STIRRED UP. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. BUT SPEAKING ON SUNDAY, MR KINNOCK SAID: ""WE WILL BE FORCED TO USE THESE CONTINGENCY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE MESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm. But Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the barge as “a sign of failure” by the Government, noting that 10,000 more asylum claimants have been moved into hotels since Rishi Sunak vowed to “stop the boats” coming across the Channel as one of five pledges the Prime Minister made in January. The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said.

Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

That contract, which was also awarded without competition under the same framework as the new barges, covered two ships and hotels, and had an estimated value of £100m. CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels. It is right that we explore all available options. “CTM was awarded the contract to deliver accommodation for the Home Office after an extensive procurement process and has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation. “We are pleased that they will be providing management for Bibby Stockholm, the two additional vessels announced by the prime minister, as well as bridging accommodation and travel services.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20231107205558/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,0

In 2021, the figure was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. A month ago, Rishi Sunak delivered a major speech, insisting small boat crossings were down 20 percent since he unveiled his illegal crossings plan five months earlier. However, he received criticism at the time as the fall had been caused by a windy first few months to 2023, which had driven crossings down. Mr Sunak boasted that his 'plan is working' Nigel Farage warned Mr Sunak that his hubris would be undermined when the wind dropped, and said the fact numbers of migrants were up in Europe should have been a cause for concern in Downing Stree. The record-high June figures include 155 migrants who arrived in three boats on Friday. Records began five years ago. Mr Sunak said stopping the boats was one of “the people’s priorities”, and vowed to “rebuild trust in politics through action, or not at all”.

The Home Office will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work. It comes after a number of construction roles were added to the 'shortage occupation list', following a recommendation by the body that advises ministers on migration issues. But the move risks angering Tory MPs as it comes just weeks after net migration to Britain was revealed to have reached record levels. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration - the number of arrivals to the UK minus the number of departures - rose to 606,000 in the year to December 2022. Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014. These hikes are expected to be enforced from the beginning of next year, after the laws are altered this autumn. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said: “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue.” “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties,” he added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230807065633/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,0

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} MPs who came up with a blueprint for reducing the number of migrants arriving lawfully into the UK have insisted they are loyal to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. IT IS DISPARAGING TO LABEL PEOPLE AS XENOPHOBES FOR HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING NET MIGRATION AT HALF-A-MILLION A YEAR CONSERVATIVE MP TOM HUNT “I THINK IT IS WRONG TO BRAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NET MIGRATION BEING AT THE LEVEL IT IS RIGHT NOW AS SOMEHOW HOSTILE TO IMMIGRATION, WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,0

In 2021, the figure was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. A month ago, Rishi Sunak delivered a major speech, insisting small boat crossings were down 20 percent since he unveiled his illegal crossings plan five months earlier. However, he received criticism at the time as the fall had been caused by a windy first few months to 2023, which had driven crossings down. Mr Sunak boasted that his 'plan is working' Nigel Farage warned Mr Sunak that his hubris would be undermined when the wind dropped, and said the fact numbers of migrants were up in Europe should have been a cause for concern in Downing Stree. The record-high June figures include 155 migrants who arrived in three boats on Friday. Records began five years ago.

The Home Office will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work. It comes after a number of construction roles were added to the 'shortage occupation list', following a recommendation by the body that advises ministers on migration issues. But the move risks angering Tory MPs as it comes just weeks after net migration to Britain was revealed to have reached record levels. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration - the number of arrivals to the UK minus the number of departures - rose to 606,000 in the year to December 2022. Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,0

Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”.

A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants. Some 175,457 people were waiting on an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June – up 44% from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since 1999.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. SOME UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING MANCHESTER, GLASGOW, SHEFFIELD, UCL AND IMPERIAL, RELY ON CHINESE STUDENTS ALONE FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,0

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. DONALD TRUMP ROSE TO POWER, IN PART, BY DEMONISING MUSLIMS, BUT NO MINORITY IN THE US REPRESENTS ANY SORT OF THREAT TO A NOW EMBATTLED DEMOCRACY, UNLIKE THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT HE STIRRED UP. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

'This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.' The Mail's investigation led to the SRA suspending three legal firms caught offering to lodge fake asylum applications. The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Two said they would falsely claim that the undercover reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers. Mrs Braverman said last night: 'Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice. While the majority of lawyers act with integrity, we know that some are lying to help illegal migrants game the system. It is not right or fair on those who play by the rules.

Robert Jenrick told pesky Peers trying to change it again that he was not willing to accept any more changes to it. 2 Migrants rescued by Border Force boat earlier this week in the Channel Credit: Gary Stone It came as former Labour MP, Simon Danczuk called for a referendum over Rwanda in a bid to push it past leftie judges and peers. The ex-MP told TalkTV: ""It's quite clear the public want us to be in charge of our borders, it should be put to them in a referendum."" MPs and Peers are locked in a battle of ping pong over the new stop the boats law, which is expected to come into force in the autumn. More than 13,000 small boat migrants have come to Britain so far this year. Ministers are desperate to finish it off before everyone goes home for the summer break.

He cited Tory grandee Lord Ken Clarke, former home secretary, who had come around to the Rwanda scheme because he felt there was no other option to try and solve the problem. Mr Jenrick added: ""The key thing that came out of the debates in the House of Lords is, it's incumbent on those who choose to criticise our plans to provide an alternative. ""This is not a serious or grown up way to conduct a debate to say, well, we have concerns about Rwanda, we don't like the compliance environment, we don't want this... but not to come up with an alternative.""

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. RATIONAL, FACTUALLY GROUNDED FEARS SHOULDN’T BE DIRECTED AT MIGRANTS AND MINORITIES, BUT AT POLITICIANS WHO SEEK TO GAIN POWER BY BLAMING THEM FOR THE ILLS AND INJUSTICES THEY CAUSED. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year. A Home Office spokesman said: “We will continue to strike the right balance between supporting the UK economy through skilled worker visas and upholding our commitment to reduce migration over time.”",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,0

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} A Labour government would temporarily continue with the governemnt's plan to house refugees on barges moored offshore, the party's immigration minister has said. Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. BUT SPEAKING ON SUNDAY, MR KINNOCK SAID: ""WE WILL BE FORCED TO USE THESE CONTINGENCY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE MESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

The justice secretary has said he would be comfortable with severe punishment for immigration lawyers who engage in malpractice after the government said they could face life in jail under the terms of the Illegal Migration Act. But a senior official from the Law Society, the body that represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed out that a government taskforce being trumpeted by ministers on Tuesday in response to allegations of wrongdoing by some solicitors in dealing with asylum applications had already been working for months before the scandal. “The solicitors’ profession wants to see all of this eradicated. It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring, said David McNeill, the Law Society’s director of public affairs. McNeill spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after three legal firms were shut down over allegations false asylum claims were being submitted for a fee. He accepted such practice could go on in the industry but said: “This taskforce which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” The government’s approach to dealing with asylum claims has included requiring people to submit a claim while physically in the UK, while also shutting off all safe and legal routes to get there to the vast majority of people. Campaigners have argued this has pushed people to try to enter by irregular means, such as by crossing the Channel in small boats.

I’m entirely comfortable with that.” Chalk added: “Most lawyers do a fantastic job, but those that don’t, those that abuse their position and act illegally, it’s very important that the system comes down on that like a ton of bricks.” He also said the backlog of cases had decreased by 17,000 over recent weeks, after Home Office figures revealed more than 50,000 people were staying in hotels in June. On Sunday, the Independent reported that thousands of cases had simply been marked as cleared without the claimant having been assessed. The news site reported that Home Office guidance allowed officials to unilaterally close cases, even where they had not been able to contact the claimant, with a letter to them simply being filed away. It said many were closed because people did not attend interviews, quoting a Home Office official as saying: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down.

Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. DONALD TRUMP ROSE TO POWER, IN PART, BY DEMONISING MUSLIMS, BUT NO MINORITY IN THE US REPRESENTS ANY SORT OF THREAT TO A NOW EMBATTLED DEMOCRACY, UNLIKE THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT HE STIRRED UP. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,0

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm. BUT LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY YVETTE COOPER SLAMMED THE BARGE AS “A SIGN OF FAILURE” BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOTING THAT 10,000 MORE ASYLUM CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN MOVED INTO HOTELS SINCE RISHI SUNAK VOWED TO “STOP THE BOATS” COMING ACROSS THE CHANNEL AS ONE OF FIVE PLEDGES THE PRIME MINISTER MADE IN JANUARY. The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said. Labour would end the use of hotels and barges, “going back to the low-cost, long-standing asylum accommodation of which we have tens of thousands of places in this country”. But pressed on Labour’s asylum policy answer if the party is returned to power, Ms Cooper said: “We don’t know what the scale of the chaos is going to be.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230811083055/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,0
