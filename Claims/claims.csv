Mr Javid is currently a Deputy Assistant Commissioner with the Metropolitan Police, and has previously held key positions at Avon and Somerset Police and West Midlands Police. He will take up his new role in November and will be tasked with the operational response to immigration offending while collaborating closely with other law enforcement agencies, including the police and Border Force. Mr Javid said: “Protecting the integrity of the UK’s immigration system is vital, so it is an honour to be appointed to this important role. “I am excited to begin leading a group of dedicated, hard-working and talented public servants to ensure we uphold our rules and laws.” Bas brings a wealth of law enforcement experience and will further ramp up our efforts to tackle immigration offending, as the British people would expect According to the Home Office, immigration enforcement visits are at their highest since 2019 and are up by almost 50% on last year. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: “Immigration abuse is a scourge on our society and I will leave no stone unturned in clamping down on this illegality. “BAS BRINGS A WEALTH OF LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE AND WILL FURTHER RAMP UP OUR EFFORTS TO TACKLE IMMIGRATION OFFENDING, AS THE BRITISH PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT.” HOME OFFICE PERMANENT SECRETARY SIR MATTHEW RYCROFT ALSO WELCOMED THE APPOINTMENT, SAYING HE LOOKS FORWARD TO WELCOMING MR JAVID TO THE HOME OFFICE AND WORKING ALONGSIDE HIM TO “TACKLE ILLEGAL MIGRATION, WHICH IS THE TOP PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT”.

His new appointment coincides with new arrivals appearing to take Channel crossings to more than 100,000 since 2018. PA news agency analysis of Government figures since current records began on January 1 2018 showed that, as of Tuesday, 99,960 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey.

Following a small boat incident off the coast of Dungeness in Kent earlier today an RNLI lifeboat safely led assure the migrants. It comes after figures from the Ministry of Defence showed more than 7,600 people, thought to be asylum seekers, arrived in Britain in small boats between October 25 and December 31. Home Office figures up to Friday suggest that almost 17,500 people have arrived via the same route in 2023. During a visit to a nursery in North Yorkshire, Mr Sunak stated that stopping the boats was one of his top five priorities ahead of next year's likely general election. A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dungeness, Kent Following a small boat incident in the Channel, an RNLI lifeboat brought in the migrants It is thought the 25,000 arrivals mark since Mr Sunak's premiership started was topped on Friday when the Home Office recorded that 144 people arrived in three boats. Over the past 12 months, French authorities have been able to stop less than half of those boats seeking to cross the Channel. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said Mr Sunak had 'fundamentally failed to get a grip' on the migrant crisis in the English Channel, despite a pledge to put a stop to small boats crossing from France. 'The Conservatives have allowed criminal smuggling gangs to take hold on Britain's borders and Tory incompetence is risking our national security, putting lives at risk, and pounding the public purse for millions every day,' he said.

'It's time for a different approach. The Prime Minister must now back Labour's plan to stop the dangerous Channel crossings by going after the criminal gangs, by securing a returns deal with Europe, and by clearing the asylum backlog which is costing the taxpayer £6 million a day.' Speaking to the broadcasters earlier today, the Prime Minister said: ' One of my five priorities is to stop the boats. The current system is both unsustainable and is completely unfair, but particularly unfair on British taxpayers who are forking out millions of pounds to house illegal migrants in hotels and local communities. 'That's not right. We've got to put a stop to that. And we're working on it. 'It's not an easy problem to fix. I never said we would be able to solve it overnight. It will take time and we have to attack it from lots of different ways. BUT I AM PLEASED THAT THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS CROSSING THIS YEAR IS DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SOME YEARS. 'That shows that our plans are working, but of course there's still more to do and people should know I am determined to grip this problem, and that's why one of my five priorities is to stop the boats.'

There is not one simple solution and it can't be solved overnight and I wouldn't be being straight with people if I said that was possible.' During the same visit, Mr Sunak also defended plans to house migrants on an RAF base in Lincolnshire that has historic links to the Second World War Dambusters raid. Asked about the risk that moving asylum seekers into RAF Scampton poses to a multimillion-pound investment, he told regional broadcasters: 'Of course the Home Office and other authorities are in dialogue with all local partners to work through all the outstanding issues and questions.'

'That is why our new law in Parliament is so important. It has been opposed by other parties but I think it is the right thing to do, and we are taking action to reduce, as I say, the amount that taxpayers are spending on housing illegal migrants in hotels. 'It is millions of pounds a day - that is not right, it is not fair.' This comes after it was alleged that the Home Office is spending more than £300million on new detention centres for Channel migrants. The Home Office is seeking contractors to operate three new immigration removal centres (IRCs) designed to hold 1,000 people in total. The contracts – valued at £306million – will run for four years and 'possibly for up to a further two years', official documents say, indicating ministers expect the Channel crisis could continue until the end of the decade. A week earlier leaked documents revealed that Brussels has ruled out a deal which would allow Channel migrants to be sent back to France. Official records indicate the refusal came from one of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen's most trusted aides. German politician Bjoern Siebert told senior British officials the bloc will refuse to consider signing a post-Brexit 'returns agreement'. The migrants are not being put off by Prime Ministers Rishi Sunak's new policy 'stop the small boats' Dozens of migrants were said to be rescued by the RNLI It has emerged that more than 25,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Britain in small boats since Rishi Sunak became PM Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said Mr Sunak had 'fundamentally failed to get a grip' on the migrant crisis in the English Channel According to Ministry of Defence figures, more than 7,600 people, thought to have been asylum seekers, arrived in Britain in small boats between October 25 and December 31 Over the past 12 months, French authorities have been able to stop less than half of those boats seeking to cross the Channel Home Office figures up to Friday suggest that almost 17,500 people have arrived via the same route in 2023 On Saturday, The Mail on Sunday obtained a copy of official guidance issued to Home Office staff tasked with handling the backlog of 170,000 applications to stay in the UK by foreign nationals who arrive here in small boats or are smuggled in the back of lorries. Government documents revealed that officials have been told they cannot reject the testimony of a migrant who is caught lying. They are also ordered not to be sceptical when quizzing asylum seekers – including those who have come from safe countries. The documents showed that asylum seekers must be reassured that they need not answer upsetting questions. Home Office staff are also 'forbidden' from asking questions about 'sexual preferences or activity' in cases where migrants claim to be fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation. Earlier today it was revealed that thousands of migrants have been slaughtered by Saudi border guards this year after they opened fire on them 'like rain' as they tried to cross through Yemen into the Gulf kingdom, a major report has found. The Human Rights Watch report, released Monday, said some migrants, many of them from Ethiopia, were attacked at close range while others were fired on by mortar projectiles. Many of the migrants reportedly had their legs severed and fingers shot off as their bodies were strewn across the trail. The allegations, described as 'unfounded' by a Saudi government source, point to a significant escalation of abuses along the perilous 'Eastern Route' from the Horn of Africa to Saudi Arabia, where hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians live and work. The kingdom has previously rejected allegations of systemic killings. 'Saudi officials are killing hundreds of migrants and asylum seekers in this remote border area out of view of the rest of the world,' HRW researcher Nadia Hardman said in a statement.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12428699/Dozens-migrants-land-beach-Dungeness-following-Coastguard-rescue-Channel.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12428699/Dozens-migrants-land-beach-Dungeness-following-Coastguard-rescue-Channel.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Mr Hammond, now a Tory peer, said that the move could act to bring down stubbornly high inflation being driven by rising wages without the need for interest rate rises hammering homeowners. The former Remain campaigner lamented to LBC that when the UK was in the EU the single market and free movement would have allowed people to enter and work, but that that was no longer possible. 'That's not happening now. AND I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS REGARDED ANY RELAXATION OF MIGRATION RULES AS BEING POLITICALLY TOXIC,' HE SAID. 'But rising mortgage rates on the scale we're seeing is also politically toxic. I think we might have to have a debate about the balance between the two… 'I would guess there are plenty of people around now who are facing enormous personal financial pressures because of rising mortgage rates either now or anticipating them for when their current fixed rate deals. Mr Hammond, now a Tory peer, said that the move could act to bring down stubbornly high inflation being driven by rising wages without the need for interest rate rises hammering homeowners. Speculation is swirling that the Monetary Policy Committee might even opt for a 0.5 percentage point rise today from the current 4.5 per cent The average two-year mortgage has hit 6.15 per cent, while government borrowing has also become massively more expensive Shock figures yesterday showing prices still not slowing down have made a bump to 5 per cent a real possibility 'And that even if they were, in principle, people who liked the idea of tighter migration controls, might be willing to embrace the concept that a lower cost way of getting wage inflation down would be to soften the labour market rather than dampen the whole economy.' It came as Brits prepare for another hammer blow today with the Bank of England poised to hike rates for the 13th time in a row to curb rampant inflation. Markets are pricing in a 0.25 percentage point rise to 4.75 per cent when the latest decision by the Monetary Policy Committee is announced at noon. But shock figures yesterday showing prices still not slowing down have made a bump to 5 per cent a real possibility - heaping more agony on mortgage-payers. The respected IFS think-tank has warned that 1.4million people are set to lose a fifth of their disposable income due to the soaring costs. BoE governor Andrew Bailey has been coming under intense fire for failing to respond to inflation earlier, with some Treasury advisers arguing that Threadneedle Street now has no option but to force a recession. Rishi Sunak has batted away Tory demands for tax breaks or other support for homeowners from the government, and renewed his vow to CPI inflation by the end of the year. Labour has said banks should be obliged to let crippled mortgage-payers switch to interest-only or extend their terms - even though this hugely increases their liabilities in the long run. Panic was sparked when official figures showed headline inflation sticking at 8.7 per cent, defying expectations of a fall to 8.4 per cent and suggesting surging prices have become embedded in the economy. To hit Mr Sunak's target it will have to be slashed to no more than 5.4 per cent by the end of the year. Markets were particularly alarmed that core inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as food and energy, actually rose from 6.8 per cent to 7.1 per cent, driven in part by rising wages. Traders pushed up borrowing costs, assuming that the BoE will use its only tool to combat inflation and push up interest rates. The average two-year mortgage has hit 6.15 per cent, while government borrowing has also become massively more expensive raising questions about public services and Tory hopes of tax cuts this Autumn. Mr Sunak, who will hold a question and answer session with voters today, insisted inflation would be brought under control.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12222643/Ex-chancellor-Philip-Hammond-says-UK-RELAX-immigration-rules-avoid-recession.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12222643/Ex-chancellor-Philip-Hammond-says-UK-RELAX-immigration-rules-avoid-recession.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Mr Jenrick made the comments after a difficult week for the Government trying to control migration coming into the UK. Mr Jenrick also refused to say how many people had been removed from the UK under a deal with Albania, which targets people who have arrived in the country illegally from Albania. Mr Jenrick said hundreds of people had been removed but that others had absconded or were still being housed in hotels. He told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that it was “early days” of the deal and that deportations had been held up by “spurious last-minute claims”. The deal with Albania, which has been praised by Rishi Sunak, came after figures showed more than a third of people who arrived on small boats were from Albania.

The former shadow home secretary later deleted her tweet, which was a reference to Tory MP Lee Anderson’s use of the f word about migrants. But it prompted indignation on social media, and some commentators called for Ms Abbott to face sanctions. Her tweet was branded “obscene” and “revolting”. Rishi Sunak has backed his deputy party chairman Mr Anderson, who said migrants who do not want to live on a barge should “f*** off back to France”. However, the prime minister’s decision has divided the Conservatives, some warning him against turning the Tories into the “even nastier party” and a lurch to the right. Mr Anderson has refused to apologise for his incendiary comments, made after a group of 20 migrants were granted a last-minute reprieve as the first group boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset. ALEX CHALK, THE JUSTICE SECRETARY, SAID WHILE THE MP’S LANGUAGE WAS “SALTY”, HIS INDIGNATION WAS WELL PLACED AND HIS COMMENTS WERE “NOT BIGOTRY AT ALL”. No 10 said the cabinet minister had been speaking for the government when he backed Mr Anderson. But Dominic Grieve, the ex-attorney general who was a Conservative MP for more than two decades, told The Independent that “such foul language” would turn off floating voters and risked “making the Tories the even nastier party”. Ms Abbott, who in April was suspended from the Labour Party after suggesting Jewish people do not face racism, had been quote-tweeting a BBC news story on a shipwreck in the central Mediterranean, in which 41 people are thought to have died. “These migrants have indeed f***ed off. To the bottom of the sea,” she wrote. It’s thought she had been trying to mock Mr Anderson’s attitude. Some people who did not remember that she had already been suspended from the Labour Party called for her to be suspended or sacked. A separate row on immigration has emerged after Mr Anderson claimed that the party had “failed” on the subject. That was rejected by immigration minister Robert Jenrick and Downing Street, which said it was “making progress” but was not complacent.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/diane-abbott-migrants-sea-tweet-b2390439.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20241213161159/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/diane-abbott-migrants-sea-tweet-b2390439.html

Historical figures compiled by the Bank of England show that between 1850 and the 1980s emigration consistently exceeded arrivals. In some years before the First World War the net outflow from the UK was more than 300,000 people, meaning that any population growth was due to there being more births than deaths. It was not until the late 1990s, when Tony Blair was elected, that immigration began to add significantly to numbers in the country. Among the key changes were loosening of work permit and international student rules. The expansion of the EU then sparked a sharp rise in the mid-2000s, with large numbers coming from countries such as Poland and Hungary to work. By the time of the Brexit referendum in 2016 official figures for net immigration were running at 323,000 a year - something that is thought to have contributed to the Leave result. Historical data from the Bank of England put together with ONS estimates give an indication of how migration has changed over the years - although methodology for producing figures over the years has not been consistent However, since then there has been another dramatic spike, only interrupted briefly by Covid travel lockdown. Office for National Statisics (ONS) figures released last month showed net migration to the UK was 606,000 across 2022. That was far higher than the 488,000 level for 2021 - even though that was upgraded by 91,000 in the latest official publication. The jump was fueled by arrivals from outside the EU, largely coming to study or work, as well as to seek refuge from chaos in Ukraine, Afghanistan and Hong Kong. Some argue that workers need to come in from abroad to drive UK plc, but there have been calls for firms to attract more Brits into jobs. A strong economy and labour market makes the country more appealing for would-be migrants. The methodology for migration figures has changed over the years, and the Bank of England stresses that its historical dataset should be regarded as estimates based on 'best endeavours' rather than official statistics. Under David Cameron and Theresa May there was a commitment to bring the long-term net migration figures into the tens of thousands. The eye-watering level 2022 - roughly equivalent to adding the population of Bristol or Glasgow in a single year - sparked a furious political row after the Conservative manifesto in 2019 pledged 'numbers will come down'.

The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said the Illegal Migration Act 2023 will cast thousands of asylum seekers into “permanent limbo”, leaving them in need of continual government support such as accommodation and financial assistance. The act, which the prime minister hopes will help the government meet its pledge to “stop the boats”, prevents those who arrive using irregular routes such as channel crossings from claiming asylum in the UK. Migrants rescued from a boat crossing the English Channel land on Dungeness Beach in Kent, 21 August 2023 (EPA) Instead, arrivals will be detained and removed to either their home country or a third country such as Rwanda. But, in a threat to Mr Sunak’s hope that his approach to asylum seekers will deter small boat crossings, the IPPR has warned there is “little realistic prospect” most of those arriving by irregular routes will be returned home or removed to other countries – even if the government’s Rwanda policy is deemed lawful. Instead, the bill will mean migrants arriving in the UK are trapped in an indefinite limbo, with no path to asylum but who the government cannot compel to leave. As well as leaving thousands of asylum seekers effectively trapped in the UK and not allowed to work, the IPPR warned the Illegal Migration Act would create huge costs for the government. Even if a high number of migrants were sent from the UK to countries such as Rwanda, the cost of housing those who remain would top £5bn a year. Rishi Sunak has been warned there is ‘little realistic prospect’ most of those arriving by irregular routes will be returned home or removed to other countries despite his plans (PA Wire) If relatively few were removed, the cost of accommodating those affected by the Illegal Migration Act would be more than £6bn annually. Around £3.6bn was spent on asylum support in 2022-23, according to National Audit Office figures, including around £2.3bn on hotels. And while the government has promised to tackle the current backlog of 130,000 asylum claims, the IPPR is warning the Illegal Migration Act will create a new, permanent backlog. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said ministers have a “very narrow window!” for success on asylum. A child rescued from a boat crossing the English Channel is taken to a Home Office bus on Dungeness Beach (EPA) She said: “Even with the Illegal Migration Act fully implemented, under most plausible scenarios arrivals will still outpace removals. “This will mean a growing population of people permanently in limbo, putting huge pressure on Home Office accommodation and support systems – plus a risk of thousands of people who vanish from the official system and are at risk of exploitation and destitution.” And with a general election expected next year, Ms Morris warned any incoming government will face a “dire and increasingly costly challenge” it would need to “urgently address”. Charity Refugee Action said ministers have been repeatedly warned the “cruel” asylum policy will “bring misery to refugees, cost taxpayers billions and force people into the margins of society”. Fundraising head Ali Noyce said: “Hostile deterrence policies will never work because a tiny minority of people fleeing war and persecution around the world will always want to come to the UK to seek safety.” Refugee charity Care4Calais said ministers are “choosing to spend money on human misery”. Chief executive Steve Smith said an “effective and compassionate” system would be cheaper than the Tories’ “proxy-war against refugees”. “Meanwhile the human cost is being felt by the survivors of war, torture and modern slavery whose lives are being left in limbo,” he added. And Labour’s shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the Illegal Migration Act is a “con which will not solve the chaos in the immigration system”. HE SAID: “IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE, KEEPING MORE PEOPLE LOCKED IN LIMBO WAITING FOR YEARS FOR ASYLUM DECISIONS AND THE TAXPAYER LEFT FOOTING AN ALMIGHTY BILL.” A HOME OFFICE SPOKESPERSON SAID: “THE ILLEGAL MIGRATION ACT WILL HELP TO CLEAR THE ASYLUM BACKLOG BY ALLOWING US TO DETAIN AND SWIFTLY REMOVE THOSE WHO ARRIVE HERE ILLEGALLY. While we operationalise the measures in the Act, we continue to remove those with no right to be here through existing powers. “We are also on track to clear the ‘legacy’ backlog of asylum cases. It has been reduced by a nearly a third since the start of December and we have doubled the number of asylum decision-makers in post over the past two years.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/asylum-backlog-small-boats-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-b2396733.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20241214120845/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/asylum-backlog-small-boats-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-b2396733.html

She has worked as a journalist.'}]","YESTERDAY'S REVELATIONS — UNEARTHED BY THE MAIL'S BRILLIANT INVESTIGATIVE TEAM — THAT CORRUPT IMMIGRATION LAWYERS ARE CHARGING UP TO £10,000 TO LODGE FAKE ASYLUM CLAIMS MAKE FOR SOBERING READING. One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect. READ MORE: Special investigation exposes staff at immigration law firms briefing clients on how to LIE to the authorities to win the right to stay in Britain Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/debate/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Yesterday evening, after almost an entire day of radio silence from the Bar Council, its Vice Chair Samuel Townend KC issued a statement in response to a tweet from Rishi Sunak praising this paper's investigation. 'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair? READ MORE: The cynical story spun by a legal advisor to undercover reporters posing as an economic migrant who arrived on a small boat to help them beat the system Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/debate/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_2 - -> The answer is simple. The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

But if you're an opportunistic politician with all the backbone of a jellyfish (Starmer), then the answer is yes. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable. And why it's so damaging when, as in the case of these lawyers, they don't.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

In a letter to her successor Suella Braverman, Dame Priti said there had been an “alarming and staggering” lack of clarity about the plans for the former RAF base at Wethersfield in Essex. The site has been earmarked to house 1,700 asylum seekers by the autumn as part of Government plans to reduce the money spent on hotels. Dame Priti, whose Witham constituency is near the airfield, hit out after reports the site could be in use for five years. The first asylum seekers moved into the site in July. In her letter to Mrs Braverman and immigration minister Robert Jenrick, Dame Priti said she had asked a series of parliamentary questions but had received “no definitive answer”. “It is therefore concerning to now see that it appears that the Home Office has put in place plans to use the site for asylum accommodation for a five-year period and considers that this meets the value for money requirement,” she said. Dame Priti said the failure to provide a direct answer “gives the impression that the Home Office is being evasive”. The possibility of the site being used for five years to achieve value for money emerged in a leaked memo reported by the Daily Telegraph. Dame Priti suggested the Government was being “secretive about its intentions”. She told Mrs Braverman: “Clear answers now need to be provided by the Home Office and the Government must be transparent rather than evasive. “The lack of clarity has been alarming and staggering and I trust you will resolve this urgently.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/priti-patel-home-office-suella-braverman-robert-jenrick-raf-b2392781.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230815022708/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/priti-patel-home-office-suella-braverman-robert-jenrick-raf-b2392781.html

Children as young as two were among 35 people found 'literally fixed and screwed' into second-hand furniture in vans driven from France to Britain. A court heard the refugees were found screaming for their lives at ports in Dover and Portsmouth between August and October, 2019. Five men have previously been sentenced at Reading Crown Court for their roles but a sixth, Constantin, 36, fled to his native Romania. Constantin was jailed today for three years and two months at Birmingham Crown Court after being extradited back to the UK to face justice. Constantin was jailed today for three years and two months at Birmingham Crown Court after being extradited back to the UK to face justice Children as young as two were among 35 people found 'literally fixed and screwed' into second-hand furniture in vans driven from France to Britain During the sentencing, Judge Sarah Buckingham told Constantin 'You helped to traffic them in appalling circumstances for financial reward, 'They were transported like chattel' He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration laws and failing to surrender to bail The court was told Constantin, of Walsall, West Midlands, acted as a 'minder' to assist gang members with transporting vans and drivers to France from Dover. The hides, bought from charity shops and from which the migrants had no way of escaping, were used to conceal up to seven people per journey. During the sentencing, Judge Sarah Buckingham told Constantin: 'In 2019 you were part of a group who travelled to and from France using a van bought specifically for this purpose, using different routes and sometimes travelling on false plates. 'The vans would contain second hand furniture bought from charity shops and then customised in order to conceal people inside the furniture and then transported back to the UK. 'Human beings were literally fixed or screwed inside furniture that were put into the vans. 'The space was confined, a confined space and hot and enclosed with little air. This was repeated and motivated by financial gain. 'It was not motivated for humanitarian reasons. You were not helping out desperate family members, rather, strangers. 'No doubt who had paid a lot of money to be transported who were, by their situation, age and circumstances, highly vulnerable. 'The circumstances of their transportation were barbaric and dangerous. 'They were vulnerable people desperate to escape life threatening circumstances in their own countries. 'You helped to traffic them in appalling circumstances for financial reward. They were transported like chattel.' Craig Evans, who was part of the prosecution, said vans were intercepted on six occasions at Dover and that 35 people of all ages, including one in a wheelchair were found. He said 'This case concerns the organised illegal smuggling of people into the UK over a number of months in 2019. 'In short vans were purchased in the UK for the purpose of these trips. 'Second hand furniture was bought from charity shops in the UK and put in the rear of the vans as cover.' He said that those who were smuggled, all from Afghanistan, were concealed with the furniture and the drivers of the vans were all from Romania. The conspiracy involved booking of hotels and flights while the organisers kept their distance and did not go on the trips. Mr Evans said Constantin had been involved in one trip using a Mercedes Sprinter van in September, 2019. On that occasion, seven people, including one who was in a wheelchair, were recovered from the vehicle while Constantin was arrested after travelling as a foot passenger on a ferry. Mr Evans said the oldest refugee was 69 while the youngest was born in 2017 and added: 'He kept himself a safe distance away when the riskiest part of the operation was being conducted, the illegal immigrants getting through the border.' Hugh Mullan, who was part of the defence, said Constantin had succumbed to temptation after getting into a desperate financial situation and he had only been involved in the conspiracy for two weeks. IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK SAID AFTER THE CASE: 'ATTEMPTS SUCH AS THESE TO SMUGGLE PEOPLE, INCLUDING CHILDREN, INTO THE UK IN CONFINED, COFFIN-LIKE SPACES ARE DESPICABLE AND CLEAR EVIDENCE OF WHY OUR WORK TO STOP THESE GANGS IS SO IMPORTANT. 'I want to praise the work of our Immigration Enforcement officers who work tirelessly to prevent this activity and thank the Romanian authorities for their co-operation in this case. 'Nobody should be risking their lives to come to the UK illegally. 'Today's case shows that we will stop at nothing to crack down on evil people smuggling gangs and bring them to justice.' The sentencing of other gang members in May 2022 followed a two-year investigation by Immigration Enforcement's Criminal and Financial Investigations (CFI) Unit. Home Office Immigration Enforcement Criminal and Financial Investigations Deputy Director, Ben Thomas, said: 'This is an example of the appalling tactics employed by people-smuggling gangs. 'These people will think nothing of crushing young children and disabled people into confined spaces and transporting them across Europe for money. 'Our efforts to track down those responsible for smuggling attempts like this one are not limited to UK soil. 'We will continue to work with our international partners to ensure criminals operating across the UK Border face justice for their crimes.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12170469/Romanian-smuggler-trafficked-refugees-Britain-jailed-three-years.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12170469/Romanian-smuggler-trafficked-refugees-Britain-jailed-three-years.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

The independent MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington tweeted “These migrants have indeed f***** off. To the bottom of the sea,” as she shared a news story about the disaster in the Mediterranean. The post was a response to a comment made by Lee Anderson, the deputy chairman of the Conservative party, who earlier this week said asylum seekers complaining about being moved on to an accommodation barge should “f*** off back to France”. Tory former minister Brendan Clarke-Smith tweeted: “And to think that Sir Keir Starmer campaigned for this person to be made our Home Secretary. “We all know that you can’t take Labour seriously on immigration or national security, but what a shame they also seek to exploit tragedies like this to push their warped agenda.” A Conservative spokesman told the PA news agency Ms Abbott’s tweet was “wrong”. “The fact that she deleted it suggests she agrees with us,” they added. Forty-one people are believed to have died after a boat carrying migrants capsized off Tunisia in rough seas. The metal boat carrying 45 people left Sfax, Tunisia on August 3, but the vessel was overturned by a huge wave hours into the journey. Survivors were taken to the island of Lampedusa on Wednesday after a rescue operation. Ms Abbott’s tweet was not the first criticism she made of the Tory deputy chairman for his comments.

Officials want to go after the networks’ supply chains and seize items such as engines and life jackets as they are “vital” to their tactics. Many of the vessels used to cross the Channel are manufactured in Turkey Robert Jenrick told the Daily Express: “The beaches of northern France are the goal-line; we must smash the gangs and facilitators upstream, long before they are in striking distance of the UK. “Hundreds of flimsy and unseaworthy small boats and engines are transported through Europe each year for the purpose of illegal migration. “Each consignment is a death trap; each seizure is an opportunity to save lives, end the human misery and stop illegal migrants reaching our shores. “I am determined that the UK is a leading global force in tackling illegal migration and a partner of choice to all those allies who share our determination to defeat it.” The vessels are produced using a similar plastic to that found in children’s bouncy castles Turkey has been identified as a key hub for smuggling gangs, with many of the vessels used to cross the Channel manufactured there. Border Force sources said the vessels are produced using a similar plastic to that found in children’s bouncy castles, before being rolled up onto a pallet and loaded into the back of a lorry. Many migrants hoping to reach Britain also begin their journey there and pay smugglers thousands to cross the continent. The new agreement - signed by Britain and Turkey - says the two nations will share more intelligence on the gangs known to be operating across Europe. And a new headquarters will be established in Turkey, meaning National Crime Agency and Home Office intelligence personnel will work alongside their Turkish counterparts for the first time. Officials insisted this will mean they can react to intelligence quicker. Hundreds of boats are driven across Europe every year, the Home Office said, and both Britain and Turkey will demand other European countries do more to tackle illegal migration during international summits, the agreement states.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick An Iraqi-Kurdish criminal, Ari, revealed intricate details about the complex smuggling operation and admitted many of the boats are made in Turkey. He said the traffickers each operate a route of their own and co-exist alongside each other. Ari said: “Here it is a free system. Everybody uses their own road, their own system. It is free, it is not only one road.” He claimed many migrants are attempting to cross Europe because they know there are “many” boats to the UK, Trending",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1800152/Britain-Turkey-smuggler-gangs-migrants-dinghies,http://web.archive.org/web/20240102165558/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1800152/Britain-Turkey-smuggler-gangs-migrants-dinghies

The trackers are being dubbed 'British Rolexes' by Albanians, as hundreds have been tagged after arriving in the UK, either as part of their immigration bail or before deportation following release from prison. Multiple videos show how easily the tags can be removed, with those filming them often detailing how to cut through the thin plastic bands and what to do once they are off. A comment on one clip asks: 'If I cut mine off and changed my address, would that work or am I still in trouble? ', to which a reply read: 'When you cut it off, don't go back home lol.' It comes as the Home Secretary said she will not rule out expanding the use of electronic tracking devices on asylum seekers arriving on British shores. In a round of interviews on Sunday, she said the Government was looking at it as one of a 'range of options' as concerns are growing over capacity at processing centres. One clip of a man removing his ankle tag had a Union Jack and Albanian flag emoji, along with a waving hand One TikTok user who goes by 'LocalAlbo' shared a clip of himself cutting through his ankle tag Criminals removing their trackers in online videos often appear unfazed by the threat of jail when removing their tags While wider use of tagging is being considered, criminals removing their trackers in online videos often appear unfazed by the threat of jail when removing their tags. The Telegraph reports that one man, who is asked: 'Where are the police?' flippantly replies: 'In the police station, lol. I took it off myself.' Another person appeared unbothered by the warning that removing tags can result in 28 days in jail, calling it 'nothing'. Albanians accounted for 28 per cent of foreign offenders on tags in 2022, according to data obtained by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration. Plans first mooted a year ago to tag migrants who arrive illegally in small boats are now under fresh scrutiny as Rishi Sunak attempts to get a handle on immigration and stop people illegally gaining entry to the UK. A dinghy carrying around 50 migrants drifts into the English Channel after being escorted out of French territory on Thursday The migrants could be GPS tracked in real time and required to report via text message or in person to immigration officers multiple times a day. Any attempt to remove the tag and abscond would result in any right to bail or to remain in the UK being automatically withdrawn. Asked about the prospect of tagging, Ms Braverman told Sky News: 'We've just enacted a landmark piece of legislation in the form of our Illegal Migration Act. That empowers us to detain those who arrive here illegally and thereafter to swiftly remove them to a safe country like Rwanda.' SHE SAID: 'WE NEED TO EXERCISE A LEVEL OF CONTROL OF PEOPLE IF WE'RE TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM. 'We are considering a range of options. We have a couple of thousand detention places in our existing removal capacity. We will be working intensively to increase that but it's clear we're exploring a range of options, all options, to ensure that we have that level of control over people so that they can flow through our systems swiftly to enable us to thereafter remove them from the United Kingdom.' Ms Braverman said stopping Channel boat crossings is 'what the British people expect of us'. 'It's what I passionately believe is the right thing to do. And we are making progress. We've passed our landmark legislation,' she said. 'But let's also be clear about what we're up against. We're up against a range of forces which are intent on stopping us – whether it's immigration lawyers, charities, NGOs, many of whom have very close links with the Labour Party, operating night and day to stop us from delivering this pledge through legal challenges in the courts.' One source told the Telegraph: 'Tagging is being discussed as an option.' Another source said tagging could also free-up immigration detention centres to be used for prisoners to alleviate chronic overcrowding in jails which are close to their capacity. They were quoted as saying: 'They are looking at all of these options. Given the state of prison capacity, that could reach breaking point and the Government knows that.' The approach has been dubbed 'punitive' and 'draconian' by left-wing campaigners, who argue that those fleeing to Britain for safety are being treated like 'criminals'. New Home Office figures released last week revealed Britain's asylum backlog topped 175,000 for the first time after 78,768 claims were made in the year to June. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June 2023, up 44 per cent from 122,213 at the end of June 2022.

The first group of asylum seekers were moved on to the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland, Dorset, on Monday. Lawyers soon intervened to halt further transfers after claims the 220-bedroom vessel was unsafe and unsuitable for traumatised people. “If you decline the accommodation that’s provided, such as a barge, then we will consider removing your asylum support and that individual will ultimately have to fend for themselves,” Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. The government meets its legal obligations to provide asylum seekers with accommodation and basic needs, said Jenrick, adding that the respective hotels and locations are a “no-choice basis” and not an “a la carte menu”. The announcement is part of Rishi Sunak’s “small boats week”, during which the government is planning a series of eye-catching announcements responding to mounting pressure to remove asylum seekers from hotels. A rising backlog of asylum cases has not yet been processed by the Home Office, and the cost of hotel accommodation soared to £1.9bn last year. “We’re not making anybody destitute,” said Jenrick. “They would be choosing to do so because they wouldn’t accept the perfectly decent accommodation that’s provided.” The use of barges and former military bases to accommodate some asylum seekers has been met with alarm by refugee organisations for being costly, cruel and inhumane. Concerns have also been raised over fire safety, overcrowding and threats from the far right. “We shouldn’t need to be putting people up in four-star hotels,” said Jenrick, adding that the barge in Dorset has been used for oil and gas workers, and citing the use of similar vessels for Ukrainian refugees in Glasgow and Edinburgh. “If it’s good enough for all those people, then it should be good enough for the migrants,” he said. “And we accept it is.” Jenrick also defended the Conservative party deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, who was repirted as saying on Tuesday that anyone who refused to be housed on the Bibby Stockholm “could fuck off back to France”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Refugee Council urged the Government to respond with “compassion” to the incident while Freedom from Torture accused ministers of “hostile” attitudes towards refugee protection. Opposition MPs said the tragedy highlighted the need for action to prevent dangerous crossings being made. Kolbassia Haoussou, from Freedom from Torture, said: “The tragic news of yet more deaths in the Channel, including serious injuries to many others, demonstrates the continued failure of the UK Government’s hostile approach to refugee protection. “The UK Government has used the demonisation of refugees as a tactic to distract us from their failings, which have left us with a cost-of-living crisis, the NHS on its knees, and public sector strikes. If this Government fails to humanely address this issue, then innocent lives will continue to be lost.” Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the incident “underscores the need for meaningful action” to reduce dangerous crossings, and urged the Government to focus on creating an “orderly and humane asylum system”. “We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in today’s sinking of a boat in the English Channel. Our hearts go out to the victims, survivors, and their loved ones. We also thank the rescuers who helped save many lives under harrowing circumstances,” he said. He accused the Government of “focusing on passing expensive and unworkable legislation and shutting down existing safe ways to get to the UK”, adding: “There are constructive alternatives we have set out that would create an orderly and humane asylum system.” Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it is “desperately” necessary to stop dangerous crossings and “the terrible criminal smuggling gangs who profit while lives are lost.” “Awful news coming from Channel. Another tragedy with yet more lives lost or at risk,” she said. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the latest incident was an “appalling, deeply shocking tragedy”. “We must stop these crossings and defeat the criminal people smugglers,” he wrote on Twitter. “There can be no more headline-chasing gimmicks or madcap schemes that just make everything worse.” Natalie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, said the fatal incident reinforced the need for joint patrols in the Channel. “Today’s tragedy underlines why we must stop the small boats to keep people safe and prevent loss of life in the Channel,” she said. “These overcrowded and unseaworthy deathtraps should obviously be stopped by the French authorities from leaving the French coast in the first place. “The time has come for joint patrols on the French coast and a cross-Channel security zone before any more lives are lost.” A UK Government spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident in the Channel. HM Coastguard are working on a co-ordinated response and further information will be provided in due course.” Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: “My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic loss of life in the Channel today. “I HAVE SPOKEN WITH OUR BORDER FORCE TEAMS THIS MORNING WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES IN RESPONSE TO THIS INCIDENT.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/channel-uk-government-nhs-government-natalie-elphicke-b2392031.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/channel-uk-government-nhs-government-natalie-elphicke-b2392031.html

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. IT IS DISPARAGING TO LABEL PEOPLE AS XENOPHOBES FOR HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING NET MIGRATION AT HALF-A-MILLION A YEAR CONSERVATIVE MP TOM HUNT “I THINK IT IS WRONG TO BRAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NET MIGRATION BEING AT THE LEVEL IT IS RIGHT NOW AS SOMEHOW HOSTILE TO IMMIGRATION, WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. BUT SPEAKING ON SUNDAY, MR KINNOCK SAID: ""WE WILL BE FORCED TO USE THESE CONTINGENCY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE MESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Some 300 people made the dangerous journey in five boats yesterday, according to Government figures. It takes the provision total for 2023 to date to 20,101. The figure is around 20 percent down on this time last year when more than 25,000 people had already made the perilous crossing. But this summer has seen more unsettled weather compared with last year when there was a spike in crossings in August. Migrants make the dangerous journey across busy shipping lanes on Tuesday There have been 5,369 people detected crossing the Channel so far this month, compared with 8,631 recorded in the whole of August 2022. Pictures of some of Tuesday's arrivals showed a dinghy packed with men and boys, some without lifejackets, perched on the sides while their legs dangled in the water. It comes as Rishi Sunak has urged people to ""have confidence"" in his pledge to stop small boats. Speaking during a visit to Norfolk yesterday, the Prime Minister said: ""This year, for the first time since the small boats crisis emerged, the numbers crossing are down. It's important for people to understand that.""

Mr Sunak previously played down suggestions that the lower number of crossings compared with last year was linked to poor weather conditions rather than policy decisions.

Taxpayers will foot the bill for the higher legal aid fees as ministers brace for a surge in cases as a result of new laws designed to tackle illegal migration. The Government hopes increasing fees to up to £59.39 an hour will encourage legal aid providers to take on work related to the Illegal Migration Act, which became law last week. Ministers think it will incentivise providers and enhance capacity to meet the anticipated increase in demand for legal aid advice. Anyone who arrives in the UK illegally through safe countries and receives a removal notice has eight days to challenge it, and can claim government-funded help to do so. Taxpayers will foot the bill for the higher legal aid fees as ministers brace for a surge in cases as a result of new laws designed to tackle illegal migration Under the Government's proposals, hourly rates for specified Illegal Migration Act work will be up to 15 per cent higher than existing immigration hourly rates. There will be no cap on the number of hours that can be charged for Illegal Migration Bill work because it was previously out of the scope of legal aid. Ministers also intend to remove the means test for legal aid for removal matters – meaning anyone will be entitled to it. But Tory MPs last night called for the system to be simplified so 'fat-cat lawyers' cannot profit from bogus asylum bids. Launching the consultation, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said the higher fees would ensure legal aid practitioners were 'properly remunerated for the important work they do'. He said: 'The Illegal Migration Bill... will change the law so that it is easier to remove those who arrive to the UK illegally. They will be issued with a notice to ensure their swift removal, either to their home country or a safe third country. 'Given the high volume of cases anticipated as a result of this legislation, we are proposing to pay higher fees for related immigration work. 'This will make sure legal aid practitioners are properly remunerated for the important work they do – and ensure fair payment and access to justice for all who seek it.' Tory former security minister Sir John Hayes called for more asylum cases to be thrown out without consideration if they are from a safe country. He said: 'We need to get that straightforwardness back into the system, and that will do a great deal to cut down the number of appeals, the number of cases heard, the length of those cases and the complexity of them, and therefore the amount of money the lawyers can charge. 'And that will avoid fat-cat lawyers becoming obese lawyers.' LAUNCHING THE CONSULTATION, JUSTICE SECRETARY ALEX CHALK (PICTURED) SAID THE HIGHER FEES WOULD ENSURE LEGAL AID PRACTITIONERS WERE 'PROPERLY REMUNERATED FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK THEY DO' A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAID LAST NIGHT: 'OUR ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL WILL CHANGE THE LAW SO PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE UK ILLEGALLY CAN BE PROMPTLY DETAINED AND REMOVED. 'We are consulting with providers to make sure the sector can meet increased demand for legal advice, and that cases can be resolved swiftly and fairly, to ensure we are able to break the business model of the smuggling gangs and stop the boats.' A Daily Mail investigation this week exposed rogue immigration lawyers who offered to make bogus asylum claims for an undercover reporter posing as an Indian national who had arrived in the UK illegally on a small boat to look for work. Our report found staff at some law firms were charging clients up to £10,000 to invent stories of torture, death threats and modern slavery designed to help them apply for refugee status.

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED SUPPORT TO MOLDOVA, AMID ONGOING TENSIONS WITH MOSCOW. “As the first British Prime Minister to visit Moldova, I’m pleased to announce new support to aid them in the face of Russian aggression,” Mr Sunak tweeted. “Moldova is not alone.” Moldova, which was playing host to nearly 50 European leaders for the summit, has accepted thousands of refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in March announced UK funding of £10 million for Moldova, earmarked for economic and governance reforms and including the energy sector. Mr Sunak was also due to meet his Spanish and Polish counterparts Pedro Sanchez and Mateusz Morawiecki, with whom he held a roundtable discussion on security at the summit. In attending the gathering near Chisinau, Mr Sunak was following in the footsteps of predecessor Liz Truss, who made time to attend the first meeting in the Czech Republic last October during her short-lived premiership.

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in Britain in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" as one of his five pledges to Britain after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of migrants in hotels after a record number arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings (across the English Channel) are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. He also said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country. ""WE'VE NOW RETURNED 1,800 TO ALBANIA IN JUST SIX MONTHS. We've gone from accepting around one in five Albanian asylum cases, to now just one in 50,"" Sunak said. ""So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%.""

David Neal, independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, revealed his findings following a re-inspection of Kent holding facilities, including Manston and Western Jet Foil, in January and February this year, after finding Manston at “breaking point” in October 2022. The watchdog chief said the Home Office has “started to get its act together” such as on qualified and trained staff, but that work remains to be done around strategy, data and training. Accommodation levels were a key warning flagged in the report. The inspector said: “There remains a very real danger, then, that a shortfall in the capacity of the accommodation estate will see numbers in Manston build up, with a return of unacceptable conditions resembling those seen in October 2022. “I have received no clear answer from senior officials as to where the 55,000 to 85,000 people expected to arrive in 2023-2024 will be accommodated. I do not think that anyone knows yet. This is a considerable risk.” The report cited expansion plans for residential holding rooms at Manston where people could be detained for up to 96 hours, but that it will take several months before they are ready to use. Mr Neal added that Home Office data collection on the initial processing of people arriving in small boats remains “inexcusably awful” but that a new leadership team is in place to face the realities of a “really complex, challenging summer ahead”. Mr Neal said reliable data was vital to focus on identifying vulnerable migrants and that this priority must continue regardless of rising pressure and number of arrivals. He said: “I have witnessed at first hand compassion, openness, a willingness to face up to reality, and a preparedness to speak truth to power… “While the forecast for arrival numbers for this year points to challenges ahead, I am more confident that the Home Office has started to get its act together.” But the watchdog boss also addressed the “elephant in the room” as to why it has taken so long to do so, adding: “More than four years after small boats began arriving regularly on the south coast, there is only now any sense of the kind of planning and operational delivery I would expect to see.” Mr Neal is planning to revisit Manston migrant centre when it is busier for another inspection this year.

In 2021, the figure was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. A month ago, Rishi Sunak delivered a major speech, insisting small boat crossings were down 20 percent since he unveiled his illegal crossings plan five months earlier. However, he received criticism at the time as the fall had been caused by a windy first few months to 2023, which had driven crossings down. Mr Sunak boasted that his 'plan is working' Nigel Farage warned Mr Sunak that his hubris would be undermined when the wind dropped, and said the fact numbers of migrants were up in Europe should have been a cause for concern in Downing Stree. The record-high June figures include 155 migrants who arrived in three boats on Friday. Records began five years ago. Mr Sunak said stopping the boats was one of “the people’s priorities”, and vowed to “rebuild trust in politics through action, or not at all”.

Recall that public sector workers in the UK, including teachers and health workers, have recently embarked on strikes demanding a pay increase across the country. Sunak said if the government is to prioritise paying public sector workers more, the money has to come from somewhere else because he is not prepared to increase people's taxes and does not think it would be responsible or right to borrow more as it would only worsen inflation. “So, what we have done are two things to find this money. THE FIRST IS, WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE THE CHARGES THAT WE HAVE FOR MIGRANTS WHO ARE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN THEY APPLY FOR VISAS, AND INDEED SOMETHING CALLED THE IMMIGRATION HEALTH SURCHARGE (IHS), WHICH IS THE LEVY THAT THEY PAY TO ACCESS THE NHS,” SUNAK ADDED. According to the prime minister, an increase in fees is imminent, projecting a revenue boost of over one billion pounds. He noted that the proposed adjustments encompass a broad range of visa application fees, which are set to rise significantly. Similarly, the immigration health surcharge for legal migrants entering the country will be raised. “All of those fees are going to go up, and that will raise over a billion pounds. Across the board, visa application fees are going to go up significantly, and similarly for the immigration health surcharge for migrants who are coming to this country legally.”
  The Prime Minister had stated a few weeks earlier at the US embassy that he would be raising fees for processing non-immigrant visa (NIV) applications. According to a statement on the US embassy's website, the new fees for various visa categories will go into effect on Monday, June 17, 2023.",https://guardian.ng/news/uk-increases-visa-fees-health-charges-for-nigerians-other-immigrants/,http://web.archive.org/web/20241214121911/https://guardian.ng/news/uk-increases-visa-fees-health-charges-for-nigerians-other-immigrants/

The BBC football pundit said he 'didn't know what to do' and described the moment as 'cringe' as it took place while he was at the heart of a media furore over whether his comments were acceptable for a freelancer at the BBC. Lineker responded to a Twitter user who took issue with him commenting on immigration and refugees arriving in the UK by saying: 'This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people, in language not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s and I'm out of order?' After outcry from some of the public led to Lineker being suspended as host of Match of the Day, triggering a mass refusal among the BBC's football pundits to appear on any of the corporation's programming. Now Lineker has denied accusations he is 'preachy' claiming to instead just have 'opinions' on things, as he told the Telegraph being 'woke' is a 'compliment'. Gary Lineker has told how he received a 'standing ovation' in M&S after his controversial tweet about immigration policy In May the Match of the Day presenter told how he wants to use his 'big platform' for 'good' The former footballer described the incident in M&S as he reflected on the media frenzy which erupted following his tweet, adding wryly that everyone was already standing in the supermarket before he arrived. IN MAY THE MATCH OF THE DAY PRESENTER TOLD HOW HE WANTS TO USE HIS 'BIG PLATFORM' FOR 'GOOD'. Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said: 'I think it's really important if you've got a big platform to try and use it for what you think is for the good and that's what I have always done and will continue to do.' Last night he called for more kindness in politics, saying it is currently 'aggressive and hateful'. He continued: 'I would ask you, what is ""woke""? Is it a bad thing? Is it just referring to people who have some kind of social conscience? I don’t necessarily find being called woke an insult.' He has joined a swathe of other celebrities who describe being woke as a positive attribute, demonstrating a desire to introduce more empathy and less division into contentious issues. After the presenter was taken off air, the BBC led by Tim Davie was forced to make a humiliating climbdown following a Match of the Day which saw just a few minutes of highlights from the Premier League, with no music, commentary or linking sequences. Lineker returned to screens the following weekend, along with the rest of the BBC's football team. He has since confessed he became emotional when he heard other presenters were refusing to replace him or appear on air in support, admitting to crying in the back of a taxi after he discovered co-hosts Ian Wright and Alan Shearer had declined to appear without him. Many employees at the BBC have to be politically neutral on social media under guidelines which apply to full-time members of staff. The BBC is said to be reviewing its policies in the wake of the Lineker scandal, but so far no changes have been announced. Human rights organisation Amnesty International previously called for Lineker to be able to speak out on refugees despite his opinions leading to accusations of BBC bias.

Rishi has repeatedly refused to commit to the promise - which would mean cutting immigration by around 400,000 in a year. The group of mainly Red Wall MPs - which includes Lee Anderson, Tom Hunt and Danny Kruger - have come up with a radical three point plan to slash numbers. It is: :: Increase salary thresholds so foreign workers have to earn more to move here :: Massively extend the crackdown on foreign students bringing their family to Britain with them :: Restrict foreign workers from bringing relatives over to the UK with them Their blueprint risks reigniting the Tory civil war and damaging the party in the run up to three nightmare by-elections. The group is expected to savage our failing migration system - accusing Britain of being addicted to cheap foreign labour. This undercuts wages and shatters faith in the system, they will add. The Tories are in danger of “eroding public trust” unless they get a grip on the crisis, a source close to the group said.

He told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that it was “early days” of the deal and that deportations had been held up by “spurious last-minute claims”.

The Home Office said the unit would bring together regulatory bodies, law enforcement teams and other government departments to take action against advocates found to be deceiving the courts. It comes after the Daily Mail reported that a number of solicitors agreed to help an undercover journalist posing as an economic migrant submit a false application in exchange for thousands of pounds. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice. Home Secretary Suella Braverman But the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. It added the Home Office is focusing on a “tiny minority of lawyers” rather than “significant” asylum claim backlogs and “the unworkability of the Illegal Migration Act”. The Home Office said the Professional Enablers Taskforce, for which there is no new funding, had been carrying out preliminary work over the past few months. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity, according to the department. Police referrals have also been made where criminal activity is suspected, the Home Office said. The announcement came after the first 15 migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson was reported to have said asylum seekers complaining about the barge, moored off the Dorset coast, should “f*** off back to France”. Home secretary Suella Braverman, speaking about the task force, said: “Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice. “While the majority of lawyers act with integrity – we know that some are lying to help illegal migrants game the system. It is not right or fair on those who play by the rules. “THE BRITISH PEOPLE WANT US TO PUT AN END TO ILLEGAL MIGRATION – I AM DETERMINED TO CRACK DOWN ON THESE IMMORAL LAWYERS AND STOP THE BOATS.” SPEAKING TO THE DAILY MAIL, MS BRAVERMAN SAID: “THESE CONMEN MAKE IT FAR HARDER TO REMOVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE HERE – AND THEY MUST FACE THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW. “I want to see the worst offenders in jail and we have the laws in place to bring them to justice. “I know our teams are working incredibly hard to root out those who game our asylum system and cheat the British public – this can’t go on.” Justice secretary Alex Chalk said: “The accuracy and honesty of legal advice underpins the integrity of our world-leading legal system, so those who undermine it by encouraging deception must be held to account. “This government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.” But Richard Atkinson, deputy vice president of the Law Society, said: “This ‘task force’ has been around for months now, so it is not clear what, if anything, the government is announcing today.” He added: “The government, regulators and law enforcement agencies already have the powers they need to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. “The overwhelming majority of immigration lawyers continue to support the rule of law through their adherence to the law and professional standards set by the Solicitors Regulation Authority and provide an essential service to clients. “The focus of the Home Office on a tiny minority of lawyers to which they are apparently applying considerable resources should not deflect from the fact that there remains significant backlogs in asylum claims or the unworkability of the Illegal Migration Act.” Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system. Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC said lawyers must observe ethical and conduct rules which apply to them while advising and representing their clients, with appropriate sanctions if they breach them. He said: “The task force must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers.” For Labour, shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said it was “too little too late” and the “buck stops” with the Conservatives, accusing them of having “sat idly by for 13 years while illegal migration has spun out of control”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” The first asylum seekers arrived at the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland on Monday, with the Home Office saying people are expected to be housed there for between three to nine months. Cheryl Avery, the Home Office’s director for asylum accommodation, confirmed 15 people were moved onto the vessel as part of the government’s bid to cut the cost of hotel bills by finding other accommodation, which also includes former military bases. Care4Calais said around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Tory MP Mr Anderson, on those complaining about the accommodation, told Express.co.uk: “If they don’t like barges then they should f*** off back to France.” He added: “I think people have just had enough. “These people come across the Channel in small boats, if they don’t like the conditions they are housed in here then they should go back to France or better not come at all in the first place.” Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels has passed 50,000.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/suella-braverman-immigration-lawyers-task-force-b2389275.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/suella-braverman-immigration-lawyers-task-force-b2389275.html

Lawyer Vinnasythamby Lingajothy (pictured) offered to invent a horrific back story of torture, beatings, slave labour and death threats for an asylum application. He has been banned from working for solicitors' firms Muhammad Azfar (pictured) from Kingswright Solicitors who suggested a marriage ploy to client Rashid Ahmad Khan (pictured), from Rashid & Rashid Solicitors, offered to invent dangers of life in India Malik Nazar Hayat (pictured) told our reporter the whole process would cost £5,500 in cash, a price he insists is a steal from his usual fees of £12,000 to £15,000 for similar cases After reviewing the evidence supplied by this paper, she said the regulator had taken 'urgent action' which included suspending solicitors working at three of the firms and closing these firms. She said the SRA has also made an order against a non-regulated person working at a further firm which stops him 'working with or for' any SRA regulated firm. The watchdog has also started an 'urgent on-site inspection' of two of the firms involved to 'gather further evidence' and was in talks with other enforcement agencies to 'co-ordinate our actions', she said. And Ms Bradley said the regulator was also launching a 'wider inspection of the immigration sector' to examine compliance with its new guidance. 'This will commence in the next few weeks and will include a cross section of firms working in the asylum sector and take into account the issues raised by the Daily Mail investigation.' The SRA would also be 'expanding and promoting the information' on our rules and best practice we have available to law firms, she said. 'This will include new guidance that will take account of the serious issues raised by the Daily Mail investigation and will ensure that solicitors are aware of their professional obligations.' In the letter, she added: 'We very much agree that public trust and confidence is fundamental to a strong and healthy legal profession and, like you, we were shocked by the apparent behaviour of those solicitors identified by the Daily Mail recently. The swift response came after Rishi Sunak (pictured) and Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk had said the allegations of 'appalling' conduct must be met with the 'full force of sanctions' 'As you acknowledge in your letter, solicitors play an important role in our society and the vast majority behave in an appropriate and professional manner, providing high quality, much needed advice and assistance to their clients. 'However, in areas of law where the consequences for clients are so severe, such as in immigration services, these high standards are even more critical.' She added that 'due process must be followed' and fairness for all involved was paramount. Our damning investigation, using a reporter posing as an economic migrant who had arrived in the UK illegally, found legal staff readily offering to help him submit false asylum claims, in apparent contravention of the solicitors' code of conduct. One legal adviser even offered to supply the reporter antidepressant medication to show the Home Office as 'evidence' that he was traumatised. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. The SRA has the power to levy substantial fines and even shut down law firms with immediate effect. Crucially, it can also refer rogue lawyers to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, which can levy unlimited fines and strike off solicitors, leaving them unable to practise. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she suspected that the Mail's findings were the 'tip of the iceberg' and warned that some of the practices went beyond potential professional sanctions and were 'potentially criminal.' However, a loophole in the law means that while migrants can face criminal sanctions for submitting false claims, it is much harder to prosecute their lawyers.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12357485/Shut-Solicitors-watchdog-dramatically-closes-three-legal-firms-caught-offering-submit-false-asylum-claims-thousands-pounds-following-Mail-expos.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12357485/Shut-Solicitors-watchdog-dramatically-closes-three-legal-firms-caught-offering-submit-false-asylum-claims-thousands-pounds-following-Mail-expos.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

The Home Office will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work. It comes after a number of construction roles were added to the 'shortage occupation list', following a recommendation by the body that advises ministers on migration issues. But the move risks angering Tory MPs as it comes just weeks after net migration to Britain was revealed to have reached record levels. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration - the number of arrivals to the UK minus the number of departures - rose to 606,000 in the year to December 2022. Visa rules are being eased for foreign bricklayers, roofers, carpenters and plasterers after construction workers were deemed to be in short supply The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, will temporarily relax restrictions to enable more overseas builders to come to Britain to work Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed net migration rose to 606,000 in 2022 - breaking the previous record of 504,000 from the year to last June Conservative MPs said today's announcement of visa rules being relaxed for foreign builders 'underlined the need' for Britain to better train its own workforce to fill vacancies. Home Secretary Suella Braverman used a speech in May to claim there was 'no good reason' why the UK cannot train its own lorry drivers, butchers or fruit pickers - three sectors that have also had visa restrictions eased - in order to bring immigration down. She insisted Britain must not 'forget how to do things for ourselves'. The Home Office this afternoon announced that bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers were among the roles being added to the shortage occupation list 'to stimulate development, attract new talent and grow the economy'. It follows recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee, which found earlier this year that vacancies in the construction sector had 'risen substantially' relative to pre-pandemic levels. For those roles for which there are deemed to be a shortage of workers, new recruits can be paid 80 per cent of the job's usual 'going rate' and still qualify for a visa. They will also benefit from a lower visa application fee. But they will still need a sponsored job offer from an employer and to meet English language requirements under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. A wider review of the shortage occupation list by the Migration Advisory Committee is expected this autumn. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told MailOnine that today's Home Office announcement 'simply underlines the need for more homegrown highly skilled workers'. 'The Prime Minister is therefore right to point out that, for up to 20 per cent of graduates, they’d be much better off with a good quality apprenticeship,' he added, in reference to Rishi Sunak's efforts to crack down on 'rip-off' degrees and to boost apprenticeships. MARCO LONGHI, TORY MP FOR DUDLEY NORTH, POSTED ON TWITTER IN RESPONSE TO THE HOME OFFICE ANNOUNCEMENT: 'THIS IS NUTS.' Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of industry body Build UK, said: 'It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles. 'So we welcome the news that five occupations will be added to the shortage occupations list which will help the industry continue to deliver the schools, homes, hospitals and infrastructure that we need.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12306971/Ministers-relax-visa-rules-foreign-bricklayers-roofers-carpenters-plasterers-Home-Office-deems-shortage-construction-workers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Mr Sunak wore heavy boots and a stab vest as he joined officers on the raid in Brent, north west London, early on Thursday morning. It comes after he promised to abolish the backlog of around 92,000 asylum claims by the end of 2023. However, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs on Wednesday that the target will not be met at the “current pace”. Asked after the raid about Ms Braverman’s comments, Mr Sunak said: “It was good to be out this morning with our immigration enforcement team and seeing first-hand their work to tackle illegal working. “That’s an important strand of our work, to stop the boats and tackle illegal migration. “And that’s because the criminal gangs use a business model that tempts people here with the offer of black market work. “IT’S NOT RIGHT, WHICH IS WHY WE’VE INCREASED RESOURCES FOR IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. “We’ve increased the number of raids like the one I was on this morning by 50% and we’ve doubled the number of arrests.” He added: “But we’re not complacent. “There’s lots of work to do, which is why it’s so important that we pass our Bill through Parliament, our Stop The Boats Bill, which will mean that if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay. “We will be able to detain you and then swiftly remove you.” Not long after Mr Sunak returned from the raid, Ms Braverman met French interior minister Gerald Darmanin in London. The pair discussed UK-French co-ordination on topics including joint work tackling illegal migration and stopping the boats in the Channel.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-government-brent-gerald-darmanin-b2358408.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-government-brent-gerald-darmanin-b2358408.html

After undergoing a beating in the House of Lords – where it has been defeated no less than 20 times - last night the government was forced to announce new amendments to the proposed legislation, in what is expected to be seen as a win for Tory rebels. Key changes include that the law will not apply retrospectively to migrants who have crossed the Channel. The Home Office also it had brought in “safeguards” after being subjected to House of Lords scrutiny. But when it comes to bans on e-entry, settlement and citizenship, the law will still apply retrospectively to those who arrived illegally on or after the date of the bill’s introduction – so 7 March. The Home Office said it would ensure that the list of definitions of “serious and reversible harm” cannot be changed in secondary legislation. Other changes include that the first tier tribunal can grant immigration bail after eight days to unaccompanied children who have been detained for the purpose of removal. This is a reduction on the proposed 28 days. Pregnant women cannot be detained for more than 72 hours, but it can be extended to seven days if it is authorised by a minister.

I’m asking largely about healthy young people, albeit exhausted ones. Migrants, who have braved long, terrible journeys, often experiencing horrific violence and terror. So how many should we write off as justifiable collateral damage in our war against … what, exactly? There is no war except with ourselves: it’s a culture war. The cause is “strong borders”, but strong against what? Despite the rhetoric, this not an invasion. If the strong borders are to protect our economy – well, these are young, fit workers who could boost our economies if we actually let them work. The question of what number of deaths is acceptable is pertinent because we are actively pursuing policies that increase these avoidable deaths. So far this year, more than 2,000 people are estimated to have drowned in the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach European shores. About 650 people died when a single overcrowded boat sank off Greece in June. Just 104 were rescued. This month, 41 passengers died off the coast of Italy, 63 perished trying to reach Spain, and at least six people died in the Channel off the French coast, while trying to reach Britain in a small boat. The number of deaths rises as we normalise them. Will we reach a point of revulsion, where the public can no longer tolerate such tragedy, or will such a threshold rise with the deaths and the diminishment of our humanity? It is almost exactly eight years since the image of a drowned toddler washed up on a Mediterranean beach shocked the world into compassion. Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old, escaping war in Syria, had been attempting to reach Europe with his family when their small boat capsized on 2 September 2015. But the humane speeches from leaders proved a temporary reaction and, although the number of refugees seeking safety in Europe has fallen far below those at the height of the Syrian conflict, border policies have hardened and leaders have grown ever more hostile in speech and actions. We have allowed the political discussion around migration to be dominated by populist party sloganeering and driven by the sales agenda of tabloids with confected campaign stories. It has resulted in a swath of brutal and costly policies in Europe and north Africa, where people at their most vulnerable are tormented with impunity – and in no safe routes. In the UK, where mismanaged and delayed processing of asylum claims has created a backlog of more than 136,000 applicants who are forbidden to work, hotel housing costs are running at about £2.3bn a year. Thus riled by his government’s failures, Sunak has declared war on asylum seekers with a barrage of measures from the cruel to the unworkable to the ridiculous. These include last month’s drastic Illegal Migration Act, which torches the universal right of any human from anywhere to seek safety somewhere else on Earth (if that somewhere is Britain), and immigration minister Robert Jenrick’s petty removal of comforting cartoon murals at a detention centres holding traumatised children. ‘By the end of Sunak’s special week, the Bibby Stockholm’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated, owing to the risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease.’ Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images Sunak’s “small boats week” was not a community-awareness event marked by bake sales and fun runs in support of refugees and the RNLI. Instead, there was talk of sending migrants to Ascension Island, a remote rock in the middle of the Atlantic (even more ludicrous than the Rwanda plan), and the spectacle of a serving senior MP, a Conservative party deputy chair, telling asylum seekers to “fuck off back to France”. Meanwhile, the government pushed ahead with its plans to incarcerate a few hundred people – roughly 1% of those waiting for claim processing – on a densely packed barge off the south coast, despite expert warnings of fire and disease risk and, even more unforgivably, despite the discovery of legionella bacteria in water samples. By the end of Sunak’s special week, the barge’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated again, owing to the undeniably high risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease. This is performative politics, it is not leadership worthy of this nation, it is not governance fit for this time of true global crises. When will we look pragmatically at human movement and discuss a workable plan to manage it sustainably? THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MOVING ACROSS THE WORLD IS ONLY GOING TO INCREASE IN COMING DECADES, OWING TO POPULATION EXPANSION AND GLOBAL WARMING, CONTRIBUTING TO CONFLICTS, DISASTERS AND FOOD SHORTAGES THAT PUSH PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES. By one estimate, there are more than 110 armed conflicts going on around the world and yet, in the UK, we receive a tiny proportion of asylum seekers per citizen compared with EU nations, let alone internationally. This is not an immigration crisis – but in the coming decades, it very much could be if we don’t plan today. This year, we’ve seen a taste of the climate chaos that will only worsen, with fires, floods, hurricanes and heat affecting nations on every continent displacing millions of people. In six years, some 2 billion people could be living in places where average temperatures exceed 29C; by the end of the century, this number approaches 4 billion. This summer, traumatised British refugees arriving in small boats from the wildfires in Rhodes were treated with kindness and generosity by Greek communities when they landed. They were lucky enough to have the papers (and skin colour) to receive asylum. It is in all of our interests to prevent a climate apartheid of safety on our shared planet. Even if we in the UK are not directly affected by extreme conditions, as holidaymakers or residents, we are, by extension, through our globalised human network. For instance, about half of our food is grown overseas, much of it in highly vulnerable areas, thus increasing prices. As conditions become too extreme, people will have to move. So too will capital, expertise, production, industry … everything will shift in response. The number is not fixed, and we still have plenty of choices. If we want fewer people to move, we need to fund places to adapt, and to rapidly speed our decarbonisation so the push factors aren’t worse. But inevitably people will move. We need an honest discussion about how we manage this movement, in our cities, nationally, and in collaboration with neighbouring nations – most of which are, like Britain, facing a shrinking labour force. This must be a moment of decision. Do we plan a workable way forward, adapting our border policies to accommodate the reality of this movement? Or do we decide that mass drownings of healthy young people are just fine?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars

Encouraging illegal immigrants to get married to a British resident may be an old ruse, but it's still as effective. Handing out anti-depressants to use as 'evidence' of trauma is less well-known, but equally vile. BY MISLEADING THE COURT, AS THESE ADVISERS PROPOSED DOING, NOT ONLY ARE THEY IN BREACH OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL DUTIES, BUT MANY WOULD BE COMMITTING CRIMINAL OFFENCES: NAMELY, PERVERTING THE COURSE OF PUBLIC JUSTICE, WHICH USUALLY – AND RIGHTLY – RESULTS IN AN IMMEDIATE CUSTODIAL SENTENCE.

Their actions make it harder for those most in need to have their claims fairly heard. It is almost beyond my comprehension that advisers working for firms governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority could instruct applicants on how to make up stories. For the firms that employ these advisors, ignorance should be no defence. The senior solicitors might not themselves have urged claimants to lie, but it is their responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen. There should have been safeguards, such as regular audits, to make sure employees were behaving ethically and lawfully. Their failure should carry severe consequences. One of the great popular myths about the legal profession is the idea that we lawyers treat the truth as something flexible. The question I'm always asked in a black cab is: 'How can you defend a murderer when you know he's guilty?' And the answer is: 'I can't defend him if he tells me he did it. Legally and ethically, it's forbidden.' Every law student learns legal ethics at the very start of their training. It's impossible to gain any qualifications without understanding them. In fact, one of my favourite dictums – and one that I pass on to young people coming into the profession – is: 'Never do anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the Daily Mail.' That's a great rule of thumb to help concentrate the mind on where the grey areas of ethics start. But the alleged behaviour of these lawyers in flouting immigration rules is not in any grey area. If true, it's as bad as any criminal I've prosecuted. If these allegations are proven, these men must be struck off, imprisoned and disgraced. Nothing else will do.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337539/JERRY-HAYES-Mail-uncovers-legal-advisors-coaching-clients-game-lawyers-make-harder-REAL-asylum-seekers-writes-JERRY-HAYES.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337539/JERRY-HAYES-Mail-uncovers-legal-advisors-coaching-clients-game-lawyers-make-harder-REAL-asylum-seekers-writes-JERRY-HAYES.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

In an interview with Sky News, the unnamed asylum seeker said he was meant to board on August 1, but he has sought a legal intervention due to his age and physical and mental health grounds. On Monday, 15 people spent their first night on the vessel, docked in Portland Port, but 20 refused to board due to a 'severe fear of water', according to their lawyers. The asylum seeker said being 'squeezed into a small space' on the barge would remind him of hiding from the Islamic State group (IS) - and would be similar to what he had escaped from back home. The man said: 'We are all running away from war, trauma and conflict. A Syrian asylum seeker has said living on the Bibby Stockholm barge (pictured in Portland Port today) would remind him of hiding from ISIS 'We're looking for more space so if you put me and squeeze me into a smaller place, you are putting me back into that small room where I was hiding when ISIS were attacking our area. 'So it just reminded me again that we are in a two metre by two metre room and ISIS troops are around and you have to hide.' He was told only at the end of July that he would be moved onto the barge from a hotel he had been living in for six months in Bournemouth. The vessel's previous capacity of 222 has been doubled to 500 by putting bunk beds in its cabins and converting some communal rooms into dormitories for four to six men. However the idea has been slammed by campaign groups and charities and 'shameful' and likely to be a 're-traumatising' experience for those who have had to flee from their home countries. In an open letter to Bibby Marine, the barge owner, over 40 organisations called the housing 'cruel and inhumane.' And Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK's refugee and migrant rights director, said: 'It seems there's nothing this Government won't do to make people seeking asylum feel unwelcome and unsafe in this country. 'Reminiscent of the prison hulks from the Victorian era, the Bibby Stockholm is an utterly shameful way to house people who've fled terror, conflict and persecution. The unnamed asylum seeker told Sky News in an interview that being 'squeezed' into the small rooms would remind him of hiding from ISIS People board the Bibby Stockholm immigration barge on August 8 in Portland Port - after 20 refused People are seen carrying rucksacks and plastic bags as they climb aboard the Bibby Stockholm today The Bibby Stockholm is seen moored in Portland this morning 'Housing people on a floating barge is likely to be re-traumatising and there should be major concerns about confining each person to living quarters the typical size of a car parking space.' Meanwhile 20 others have refused to board the Bibby Stockholm due to a 'severe fear of water', according to their lawyers. Asylum seekers have been warned they must board the barge today or have their free accommodation withdrawn after 15 spent their first night on the vessel. The group's transfer onto the barge was 'cancelled' on Monday after legal challenges from representatives of Care4Calais claimed the Home Office had not screened them to see if it was suitable to put them there. The charity's CEO Steve Smith has since revealed that some of the asylum seekers it supported didn't board the vessel yesterday due to 'mental health concerns', some of which arose from being 'traumatised by seeing their friends drown at sea'. The legal firm behind the last-minute legal challenges is understood to be London-based Duncan Lewis, which played a key role in challenging the Government's Rwanda asylum scheme. However, it is understood that those who refuse to be transferred will be given 24 hours to change their minds before the Home Office considers withdrawing their free, full-board accommodation. In that event, they would be declared homeless and responsibility for their housing would pass to their local authority. More asylum seekers are set to arrive on the barge (pictured) over the course of the day A bus arrives at Portland Port in Dorset this morning Today, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk acknowledged it is 'frustrating' that just 15 migrants had boarded the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm following the legal challenges. READ MORE - What's the Bibby Stockholm like on the inside? Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> 'Of course it's frustrating. It requires a huge amount of time and effort and organisation to procure these alternatives,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'I think the British people would expect their Government to do that if it is our cheaper alternative... it doesn't diminish our resolve to solve this.' He later told Sky News: 'This is about fairness - yes to migrants - but also the British people. 'We are clear that it's safe and reasonable that people should be provided with acceptable accommodation but not accommodate that goes beyond that and costs a huge amount of money.' The migrants transferred to the barge came from hotels in Oxford, Bristol, Torbay and Bournemouth, as the government's solution to its rocketing £6million-a-day hotel bill for new arrivals was put into action. It will eventually house 500 men aged 18 to 65 as they wait for their asylum applications to be processed. Addressing the asylum seekers who were appealing against being moved to the barge, Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said: 'If they don't like barges then they should f*** off back to France.' Mr Chalk later defended his comments, telling LBC: 'Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that's his style, but his indignation is well placed.' The Justice Secretary said France is a safe country and a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. 'People should claim asylum in the first country - it's not like there should be an open shopping list of where you want to go,' he said. 'He expresses himself in his characteristically robust terms but there is a lot of sense, in my respectful view, in what Lee says.' At the port yesterday, campaigners brought flowers and welcome packs containing basic toiletries and other useful items, including a map of the area. But they were not able to give these directly to the migrants and had to leave them with security staff at the port gate. But one man vox-popped by the BBC News at 10 said they have 'en-suite showers, they're getting three cooked meals a day. Really they're living like kings.' Yesterday, new figures showed the number of migrants staying in hotels has hit 50,000, a 25 per cent increase from 40,000 in December, when Rishi Sunak promised to end the placement of asylum seekers in hotels. Ministers confirm Rwanda 'Plan B' talks Ministers last night confirmed alternative plans are being drawn up in case the Rwanda asylum deal is blocked by the courts. It came after the Daily Mail revealed yesterday that Channel migrants could be sent to Ascension Island for processing as part of a radical 'Plan B'. As a further fall-back, up to five other countries – all believed to be in Africa – are in negotiations to take asylum seekers. Home Office minister Sarah Dines said the Government was examining 'additional schemes across the globe'. Former business secretary Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said housing migrants on Ascension, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic, was previously ruled out as it would cost £1million a head and was 'thought to be impossibly expensive to do'. The £140million Rwanda deal, which involves sending migrants to the east African nation to claim asylum there rather than here, was blocked on human rights grounds by the Court of Appeal in June. Ms Dines said the Government was 'confident' it will be declared lawful, with the Supreme Court due to hear the Home Office's appeal in October, and a ruling expected six to eight weeks later. Ascension was first looked at as a possible location for a processing centre in 2021. As it is British soil, it would remove some of the legal difficulties involved in deporting migrants to a foreign state. But it is understood the plans were abandoned largely due to objections from the US military, which has a presence on the island. A source familiar with the initial negotiations said: 'The Americans didn't want people poking around there. 'You'd be sending migrants... whose affiliations are unclear. You wouldn't be able to detain them, and they'd be free to roam on the island.' The 34-square-mile territory has no hospital and moving large numbers of migrants and staff there could overload existing power and water facilities.

All bedrooms have TVs but they are not attached to aerials so can only be used by wiring them to another device, such as a laptop, while free Wi-Fi is available throughout the barge at a speed of 1gb per second. Those living onboard will take part in activities including cricket, cycling, tending allotments and going on guided hikes in the Dorset countryside. They will also take part in organised 'cultural events' and get free buses and taxis to enjoy local towns. Buses every hour from 7am to 11pm will ferry men to Weymouth, a nearby seaside resort with a beach, fishing boat fleet and marina. If they miss the 11pm bus back to the barge, free taxis are available by phoning a special number. On top of free food, accommodation and transport, each migrant is given £9.58 a week pocket money. Speaking on Monday, Mr Smith revealed that none of the 20 migrants his charity was supporting had gone to the barge as 'legal representatives have had their transfers cancelled'. 'These 20 range from survivors of torture to people who have been beaten, shot at, some arrested, some traumatised by seeing their friends drown at sea and who therefore have a severe fear of water,' he told The Telegraph. 'There are therefore mental health concerns and a very worried and very traumatised community. Details of those individuals have been passed to lawyers who have raised challenges about the suitability screening. 'There appears to have been no suitability screening. I understand that on that basis some removals to the barge have ceased.' Speaking elsewhere, he added: 'To house any human being in a ''quasi floating prison'' like the Bibby Stockholm is inhumane. 'To try and do so with this group of people is unbelievably cruel. Even just receiving the notices is causing them a great deal of anxiety.' The Stand Up To Racism campaign group said the asylum seekers who avoided transfer to the barge included nine housed in Bournemouth. A government source said: 'This just shows what we are up against: Left-wing charities and lawyers are repeatedly trying to stop us from moving illegal migrants out of expensive hotels. 'Other European countries use barges safely and at lower costs than hotels. Labour need to quit trying to sabotage our plans to stop the boats. It's time they backed the barge.' Yesterday, Portland resident Ian Broadhurst got into a heated debate with the Stand Up To Racism campaigners asking why they were giving help to strangers instead of helping poverty-stricken islanders. Mr Broadhurst, who does charity work with the local food bank and community fridge, said: 'This isn't being racist, this is saying we need to look after ourselves. We cannot afford them here when we can't even look after our own people.' Home Office minister Sarah Dines said the vessel - which previously housed oil and gas workers - would provide 'basic but proper accommodation' and that those who arrive in the UK by illegal means 'can't expect to stay in a four-star hotel'. She told the BBC on Monday: 'What it sends is a forceful message that there will be proper accommodation but not luxurious. People look out over Portland port, where the Bibby Stockholm is moored The Bibby Stockholm, pictured in Portland Port on Monday night, has received its first asylum seekers A coach arrives at the front gates as the Bibby Stockholm welcomes its first asylum seekers in Portland, Dorset Campaigners attempted to give goodie bags containing flowers, shampoo and maps of Portland to the asylum seekers 'Luxurious hotel accommodation has been part of the pull, I'm afraid. There have been promises made abroad by the organised criminal gangs and organisations which have tried to get people into the country unlawfully and they say, ''You will be staying in a very nice hotel in the middle of a town in England''. 'That needs to stop and the barge is just one of a wide range of other measures.' The vessel's previous capacity of 222 has been doubled to 500 by putting bunk beds in its cabins and converting some communal rooms into dormitories for four to six men.

She also confirmed 'all possibilities' for tackling the migrant crisis are being examined, following reports that the Government is considering reviving plans to fly people who arrive by unauthorised means 4,000 miles to Ascension Island. While only a small number of migrants are expected to be housed on the barge at first, Ms Dines suggested it could increase rapidly to its capacity of around 500 men. Pressed on whether all of them could be on board by the end of the week, Ms Dines said: 'Yes, quite possibly it will be 500. We are hoping.' But Downing Street appeared to suggest she had misspoken, with the Prime Minister's official spokesman saying that while 'no limit' had been set on how many people would board the barge this week, the Government's plan was to reach the capacity 'over time', adding: 'I don't think we are aiming to do it by the weekend.' The Home Office later clarified the total would be reached over a longer period of time and not by the end of the week. Police stand guard as a coach arrives at the front gates by Bibby Stockholm in Portlandon on Monday Campaigners brought bunches of flowers and welcome packs containing toiletries and other useful items to give them to asylum seekers arriving on the barge The group were not able to give these directly to the migrants and had to leave them with security staff at the port gate Some of the brown card bags containing bunches of flowers A range of meals will be served from the barge's canteen. Food is available 24 hours a day, including breakfast and a three-course lunch and dinner Those on board the controversial barge can make the most of comfortable sofas in the TV room Some of the residents who are against the barge say they are disgusted with the Government for ignoring their concerns about public safety and the impact the migrants will have on already overstretched local resources. It is believed Portland Port, a private enterprise, will receive £2.5million from the arrangement with the Home Office. Dorset Council and NHS Dorset are also being paid £3million for laying on extra services, healthcare and activities for them. Money will also be spent on beefing CCTV in the area and paying for additional community safety officers. Members of the Stand Up To Racism group, claimed that most asylum seekers don't want to stay on the barge. One member said: 'Every asylum seeker who got in touch with Care4Calais and told them they didn't want to go to the barge has successfully made a case. 'There were nine in Bournemouth. They have been taken off the list but one has chosen to come. 'They have been there at least four months, they've got support networks in Bournemouth, they've made a life there and they don't know anything about Portland. One said he had seen some of the hate online and was very scared.' The new arrivals will be given an 'induction' to help them understand 'what is expected in the community'. It is understood instructions on being 'a good neighbour' will include advice not to crowd together in large groups, not to carry weapons and to avoid entering children's playgrounds. A view inside the gym onboard the Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge A view inside one of the bedrooms on board the vessel, which previously housed oil and gas workers Onboard is a cross-Channel ferry-style canteen serving breakfast and a three-course lunch and dinner, although food will be available 24 hours a day. Breakfast choices include eggs, pancakes, bread and yoghurts; lunch options include potato soup, garlic chicken, Irish stew, and roast turkey with rice, and dinner choices include paella, fried fish and oriental chicken. Pictures show bottles of Ribena and Heinz tomato ketchup. In the middle of the barge are two outdoor recreational areas, each about 80ft by 30ft, where there are plans to host 'basketball, netball and volleyball' matches. There is a classroom for English language lessons, a computer room with free WiFi and a medical room with a nurse, and a GP on call. Concerns have been raised over fire safety arrangements on the barge, with only two main exits across the three decks. BUT MS DINES INSISTED THAT THE BIBBY STOCKHOLM BARGE WAS A 'SAFE PLACE' FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS TO BE HOUSED AFTER IT WAS PUT TO HER THAT SAFETY CHECKS HAD CAUSED THEIR ARRIVAL ON THE VESSEL TO BE DELAYED. Ms Dines told LBC: 'It is a safe place for people to live and stay. It is a very complex situation. 'Let us just be clear that the Government is determined to use barges such as this one to make sure we have somewhere which is proper - rudimentary but proper - accommodation for migrants.' Labour has repeatedly flip-flopped over its position on the barge, with shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock telling BBC Breakfast on Sunday that barges would continue to be used if his party won the next general election. But shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds was non-committal when repeatedly asked whether Labour supports the use of the Bibby Stockholm. Bedrooms on board contain a wardrobe as well as a small desk, chair and television The barge - moored in Portland - also offers a multifaith room A view of the doctor's room onboard the Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge Asked if Labour supports the use of the barge, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We do not wish to run and will not run an asylum system that requires the use of bases, barges or indeed of hotels, those are being used as additional accommodation because of the failure of the Conservatives to run our asylum system properly over many years.' On whether Labour supports people being moved onto the barge, he said: 'Look, I am in favour of there being safe and secure accommodation. Now there have been some concerns raised by fire experts over this barge that it's important that the Home Office address, I'm obviously not close enough to those conversations, I can't individually say whether that safety standard has been met in every single case.' Asked if he objects to the barge being used if safety standards have been met, he said: 'Government has to place people in safe accommodation, that's clear. In terms of where Labour would be, we're not in Government today, much as I would like us to be. 'Our position is we would get that backlog down. With respect, I'm not in Government today sitting there around that Cabinet table to be able to say individually which particular parts of this extra accommodation Government failure is necessitating is safe or unsafe, there have been concerns raised which the Home Office has to address.' Professor Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), has said its officials will visit the Bibby Stockholm barge 'once the migrants are there to check out some of the infection prevention control'. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The health of those on board is very much for the Home Office, when migrants enter the country they go into Home Office accommodation initially and then when they are moved to a local area that is a link with the local NHS, so my understanding is most of those initially at least going onto the Bibby Stockholm will actually have had a health assessment before they arrive there. 'And we work very closely with the Home Office in anticipation, indeed we have on this particular event.'

He will take up his new role in November and will be tasked with the operational response to immigration offending while collaborating closely with other law enforcement agencies, including the police and Border Force.

Senior Metropolitan Police officer Bas Javid, brother of former home secretary Sajid Javid, has been appointed director-general of Immigration Enforcement at the Home Office (Yui Mok/PA) Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: “Immigration abuse is a scourge on our society and I will leave no stone unturned in clamping down on this illegality. “Bas brings a wealth of law enforcement experience and will further ramp up our efforts to tackle immigration offending, as the British people would expect.” Home Office permanent secretary Sir Matthew Rycroft also welcomed the appointment, saying he looks forward to welcoming Mr Javid to the Home Office and working alongside him to “tackle illegal migration, which is the top priority for the department”. Mr Javid’s role as Deputy Assistant Commissioner at the Met involves high-level responsibilities, including overseeing specific operational areas, contributing to strategic decision-making, and holding a critical position in the force’s chain of command. His new appointment coincides with new arrivals appearing to take Channel crossings to more than 100,000 since 2018. PA news agency analysis of Government figures since current records began on January 1 2018 showed that, as of Tuesday, 99,960 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey.

The Illegal Migration Bill had been stuck in a battle between parliament's House of Commons and the House of Lords, Britain's unelected upper chamber, which had repeatedly made changes to the legislation to water it down. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, the last of those proposed changes was voted down. It can now go for Royal Assent, where it is formally approved by the king and becomes law. The legislation will help with the government's plan to send tens of thousands of asylum seekers who arrive on its shores a distance of more than 4,000 miles (6,400 km) to Rwanda. Britain struck an initial 140-million-pound ($180 million) deal with the East African country last year, however the policy remains tied up in the courts. The government is appealing a Court of Appeal ruling last month that the plan was unlawful. The first planned Rwanda deportation flight was blocked a year ago in a last-minute ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. The legislation will enable the government to stop people who arrive in Britain without permission from claiming asylum and deport them either to their country of origin or a so-called safe country like Rwanda. It has been criticised by some opposition politicians and civil rights groups as inhumane, cruel and ineffective.

'The Labour Party, a subset of lawyers, criminal gangs – they’re all on the same side, propping up a system of exploitation that profits from getting people to the UK illegally.’ Writing in the Mail today, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the probe was ‘hugely important’ and warned some of the practices were ‘potentially criminal’.

Swift action must be taken to remove from the roll all those who so egregiously abuse our laws.’ Questions surround what law could be used to prosecute solicitors and legal advisers who concoct fake stories for asylum seekers or who submit knowingly false claims. Immigrants who submit false asylum claims can face two years in jail, but there is no specific law covering the solicitors who cash in by helping them. Labour’s shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said: ‘What has been recorded in these conversations is absolutely disgraceful, and it is appalling to think that the same advice may also have been given in numerous real-life cases that we do not know about. 'It is vital that we have a credible asylum process in our country, and it is disgusting to see any legal professional actively working to undermine it. ‘If there is evidence that they have facilitated fraudulent asylum claims in real-life cases, and made financial gains from doing so, then that should rightly be a matter for immediate investigation by the police.’ Alistair Carmichael, Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, added: ‘These reports are extremely concerning and need to be looked into. 'THE GOVERNMENT’S APPROACH IS FAILING TO TACKLE THE TRAFFICKING GANGS AND ALL THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM THIS TRADE IN HUMAN MISERY.’ GARETH JOHNSON, A TORY MP WHO ALSO WORKS AS A SOLICITOR, SAID: ‘THIS SORT OF DESPICABLE BEHAVIOUR BRINGS THE WHOLE PROFESSION INTO DISREPUTE. 'If this goes unchecked if this goes it brings the whole profession down, so we need sanctions taken against these people.’ Legal authorities suggested those exposed by the Mail’s investigation could fall foul of section 25 of the 1971 Immigration Act, which prohibits facilitating illegal migration. 'But this is thought to apply only to those who help the act of unlawful entry, not helping the illegal immigrants after they have arrived. Alternatively, if they were knowingly helping people smuggler or crime gangs from the UK they could be in breach of this law.

They shame the profession to which I have devoted much of my life. A fair, honest and impartial legal system is the basis of our democracy. These revelations will shake people's faith in it. While all of us find the actions of career criminals deplorable, it is more shocking to discover that those who we expect to uphold the law are instead helping to perpetrate a fraud upon us all. I am appalled that solicitors and so-called 'legal advisers' should have behaved in such a way. To make matters worse, the cynical practices uncovered by the Mail appear to be widespread.

Encouraging illegal immigrants to get married to a British resident may be an old ruse, but it's still as effective. Handing out anti-depressants to use as 'evidence' of trauma is less well-known, but equally vile. By misleading the court, as these advisers proposed doing, not only are they in breach of their professional duties, but many would be committing criminal offences: namely, perverting the course of public justice, which usually – and rightly – results in an immediate custodial sentence.

Their actions make it harder for those most in need to have their claims fairly heard. IT IS ALMOST BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION THAT ADVISERS WORKING FOR FIRMS GOVERNED BY THE SOLICITORS REGULATION AUTHORITY COULD INSTRUCT APPLICANTS ON HOW TO MAKE UP STORIES. For the firms that employ these advisors, ignorance should be no defence. The senior solicitors might not themselves have urged claimants to lie, but it is their responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen. There should have been safeguards, such as regular audits, to make sure employees were behaving ethically and lawfully. Their failure should carry severe consequences. One of the great popular myths about the legal profession is the idea that we lawyers treat the truth as something flexible. The question I'm always asked in a black cab is: 'How can you defend a murderer when you know he's guilty?' And the answer is: 'I can't defend him if he tells me he did it. Legally and ethically, it's forbidden.' Every law student learns legal ethics at the very start of their training. It's impossible to gain any qualifications without understanding them. In fact, one of my favourite dictums – and one that I pass on to young people coming into the profession – is: 'Never do anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the Daily Mail.' That's a great rule of thumb to help concentrate the mind on where the grey areas of ethics start. But the alleged behaviour of these lawyers in flouting immigration rules is not in any grey area. If true, it's as bad as any criminal I've prosecuted. If these allegations are proven, these men must be struck off, imprisoned and disgraced.

READ MORE Figures show asylum seekers applying to UK highest in two decades Rishi Sunak urges to stop the boats “We’ve already reduced the legacy backlog by over 28,000 – nearly a third – since the start of December and we remain on track to meet our target. “But we know there is more to do to make sure asylum seekers do not spend months or years – living in the UK at vast expense to the taxpayer – waiting for a decision.” Mr Sunak added: “That’s why we’ve doubled the number of caseworkers over the last two years and continue to recruit more, and we are streamlining and modernising the end-to-end process with improved guidance, more focused interviews and rolling out the use of digital technology.” The Home Office spent £3.97billion on the asylum system in 2022/23, up from £2.12billion in a year. A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants. Some 175,457 people were waiting on an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June – up 44% from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since 1999.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. THE ASYLUM SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING FOR BRITISH TAXPAYERS AND COSTS FAR TOO MUCH. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais. A total of 19,174 asylum seekers crossed the Channel this year",https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1805833/rishi-sunak-asylum-bill-billions-taxpayers-migrant-crisis,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1805833/rishi-sunak-asylum-bill-billions-taxpayers-migrant-crisis

Tory MPs defeated opposition parties in rejecting amendments on issues such as a ten-year strategy on tackling human trafficking, abiding by international treaties, protections for child migrants and protection for LGBT migrants. Most amendments were defeated with large Commons majorities, which the Government will hope sends a message to the Lords to back down from pushing them again. THE BILL WILL NOW RETURN TO THE LORDS LATER THIS EVENING, WHERE THEY WILL HAVE TO SIT LATE TO DELIBERATE THEIR DEFEATS. The process is called Parliamentary ‘ping pong’ as the Bill goes back and forth between the Commons and the Lords. While the Lords has certain limitations on how long they can object to the will of the elected Commons, the Government is desperate to get the Bill over the line before the Commons departs for their Summer Recess at the end of this week. The Commons will likely have to return to the issue tomorrow morning and respond to whatever the Lords decided later this evening. During the debate, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said: “It’s time for the clear view of the elected House to prevail.” He called for the “will of the democratically elected” Commons to be upheld so the government can “get on with securing our borders and stopping the boats”.

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in Britain in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" as one of his five pledges to Britain after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of migrants in hotels after a record number arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings (across the English Channel) are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. He also said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country. ""We've now returned 1,800 to Albania in just six months. WE'VE GONE FROM ACCEPTING AROUND ONE IN FIVE ALBANIAN ASYLUM CASES, TO NOW JUST ONE IN 50,"" SUNAK SAID. ""So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%.""

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. This week, Suella Braverman told parliament’s Home Affairs Committee she could not predict the cost of the new Illegal Migration Bill, because there are “many unknown factors”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “MINISTERS MUST ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND VALUE FOR MONEY WHEN TENDERING SERVICES.” ANSWERING A PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION ON THE BIBBY STOCKHOLM IN MAY, IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK SAID IT WOULD BE MANAGED “BY A SPECIALIST AND EXPERIENCED PROVIDER, WHICH HAS A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF PROVIDING THIS KIND OF ACCOMMODATION”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

That contract, which was also awarded without competition under the same framework as the new barges, covered two ships and hotels, and had an estimated value of £100m. CTM declined to comment and did not answer The Independent's request for details of what the contract covered. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels. It is right that we explore all available options. “CTM was awarded the contract to deliver accommodation for the Home Office after an extensive procurement process and has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation. “We are pleased that they will be providing management for Bibby Stockholm, the two additional vessels announced by the prime minister, as well as bridging accommodation and travel services.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20231107205558/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html

Data shows Scotland is housing just 5,086 asylum seekers out of a total of 112,294. This amounts to 4.5 per cent despite Scotland making up 8.1 per cent of the UK population. Although there has been a surge in the numbers of small boats crossing the Channel, Scotland's SNP government is now hosting less than at the beginning of the year. The number has fallen from 5,210 to 5,086. Meanwhile, Labour-run Wales is hosting just 2,966. This amounts to 2.6 per cent of the UK total despite Wales making up 5.2 per cent of the country's population.

David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, said the Kent asylum centre that became overcrowded and disease-ridden last year could again become overwhelmed because ministers and officials in the Home Office are unable to say where they plan to house at least 55,000 arrivals by small boats this year. His comments come in a critical report that also warns that recruitment of staff may be hampered by “the inefficiency of civil service hiring processes and by the tightness of the labour market in the region”. Neal examined the initial processing of people arriving in Kent via small boats, including at Western Jet Foil and Manston. He said arrivals were flowing smoothly in February but “the capacity is not in place to process a large number of people arriving over a short period of time, particularly if as might well be expected sufficient onward accommodation is not immediately available”. “There remains a very real danger, then, that a shortfall in the capacity of the accommodation estate will see numbers in Manston build up, with a return of unacceptable conditions resembling those seen in October 2022,” he said. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for short periods while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. Hopes were raised that potential overcrowding this year would be avoided by government moves to increase accommodation for asylum seekers. THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER, ROBERT JENRICK, ANNOUNCED IN MARCH THAT LONG-TRAILED PLANS FOR CAMPS ON FORMER MILITARY SITES, BARGES AND CRUISE SHIPS WOULD GO AHEAD. However, many of the sites may not be ready to accept asylum seekers for weeks amid legal challenges and local protests. Neal said in his report that he had asked ministers and officials about accommodation for tens of thousands of people expected to arrive in the UK, but took away the impression that no one at the Home Office knew where they might stay. “I have received no clear answer from senior officials as to where the 55-85,000 people expected to arrive in 2023/2024 will be accommodated. I do not think that anyone knows yet,” he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neal also warned that the Home Office could face difficulties recruiting trained staff to work at centres processing migrants. “The small boats operational command is already in competition with other areas of the Home Office, with contractors, and with other employers for a limited pool of eligible potential workers. I do therefore worry that the department will be insufficiently agile to recruit and train the numbers it requires in order to respond safely and humanely to the volume of small boat arrivals that is expected over the medium term,” he said.

The Labour politician said it was 'reasonable' for people to 'resent' the idea that it was possible to circumvent the system if you are 'young, able bodied' and with enough money to pay a people smuggler. Sir Trevor, who previously served as head of the Commission for Racial Equality, said most people from a migrant background took this view because they had personally followed the rules. He warned against treating all immigrants as if they were a 'single mass' and said not enough effort was being put into identifying those who were in the country illegally. 'We've got to find who the illegal immigrants are – we're now talking about upwards of a million people – very little effort is going into that, because actually, it benefits quite a lot of people,' Sir Trevor told the Telegraph.

Sir Trevor, previously served as chair of the London Assembly, also stressed the importance of people from different ethnic groups mixing with each other rather than living in separate communities. He questioned whether the British model of multiculturalism was working when in some towns and cities people would mix together at work but in the evenings go back to areas 'in which everybody who lives there are people like themselves'.

The New Conservatives have issued a 12-point plan to cut net migration by about 400,000 before the next election. The group of 25 MPs recommend closing visa schemes for care workers, increasing salary thresholds, and capping refugee numbers. But critics say the proposals would have consequences for the UK economy. The UK's overall population grew by more than 600,000 people last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said the rise was largely driven by more people from outside the EU arriving on student and work visas, and refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in Ukraine and Hong Kong. The sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since taking power in 2010. The party's 2019 manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000. In a report launched on Monday, the New Conservatives claim the British public ""did not vote for mass migration and the social and economic harms it brings"". ""Without swift action to get migration under control, the Conservative Party will further erode the trust of hundreds of thousands of voters who lent the party their vote in 2019,"" the report says. The report was written by Tory MP Tom Hunt and backed by a group of right-wing Conservatives, including the party's deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, and backbencher Miriam Cates. One of the report's main recommendations is closing temporary schemes that grant eligibility for worker visas to care workers. The report says this policy will reduce visas granted by 117,000, leading to a reduction in long-term inward migration to the UK of 82,000. Part of this proposed policy involves only allowing in skilled workers who earn £38,000 a year or more. A report by the Skills for Care charity said the number of vacancies in social care was at its highest rate on record, with 165,000 unfilled posts in 2021-22. Ms Cates told the BBC the UK needed to cut off the supply of cheap foreign Labour and encourage from British people to fill jobs in the care sector. She said scrapping temporary visa schemes for care workers would force ""employers to look at recruiting local young people"". ""We are never ever going to make that possible unless we close the immigration route first,"" the Tory MP said. BUT FELLOW TORY MP TIM LOUGHTON SAID WHILE THE PRINCIPLE OF REDUCING MET MIGRATION WAS RIGHT, THERE WAS A SHORTAGE OF CARE WORKERS IN THE UK. ""It's not as simple as just putting the salary thresholds up as well,"" he said. ""There's quite a lot of skilled but lower paid people that we need coming into this country."" Some of the report's other proposals include:
  Tightening restrictions on student visas to stop graduates staying in the UK for longer than two years without a job offer
  Capping the number of refugees legally accepted for resettlement in the UK at 20,000
  A 5% cap on the amount of social housing that councils can give to non-UK nationals
  Raising the health surcharge that an individual immigrant would pay to use the NHS to £2,700 per person, per year
  Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said ""trying to predict the impact of individual policy changes on migration is very hard"". ""Even the most fastidious attempts to model the impacts of policy on numbers - and this isn't one of them - will usually be wrong,"" she said. She said immigration policy was a ""political choice"" and there was ""no reason the UK couldn't choose to be more restrictive"". But she said the report does not ""engage with any of the trade-offs that more restrictive measures involve"". ""For example, one of the reasons demand for care workers has been so high is limited public funding in the care system,"" Ms Sumption said. ""International students have been a growing source of revenue for universities, so proposals that would reduce student numbers cannot be considered in isolation from the funding of higher education."" She said some of the proposals in the report were ""a bit outlandish"". ""Net migration is expected to decline anyway over the coming years even without policy changes,"" she added. ""However, if they want more significant restrictions it requires an honest conversation about the wider consequences and how to mitigate them."" Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migration

The Legal Services Board (LSB) announced it will review the tools available to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to probe lawyers suspected of wrongdoing. The LSB said this could include increasing the maximum financial penalty the SRA can issue, which is currently £25,000, as well as looking at whether officials should be able to 'proactively gather information and share intelligence to help them detect and address misconduct'. Last week, the Mail ran a series of reports exposing the widespread abuse of Britain's asylum system by immigration solicitors and advisers. Legal professionals at several firms agreed to help an undercover reporter file a fabricated asylum claim to the Home Office.

HOME SECRETARY SUELLA BRAVERMAN, LABOUR'S SHADOW ATTORNEY GENERAL EMILY THORNBERRY AND LIBERAL DEMOCRAT HOME AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN ALISTAIR CARMICHAEL WERE AMONG POLITICIANS FROM ALL PARTIES THAT HAD ALSO CALLED FOR LEGAL AUTHORITIES TO INVESTIGATE. Alan Kershaw, chairman of the LSB, said: 'The public rightly expects that lawyers in England and Wales will uphold the highest professional standards and ethical conduct. 'For some time, we have been concerned that a lack of effective fining powers among some regulators, particularly the SRA, may hamper their ability to tackle wilful and serious misconduct. 'We are anxious to ensure... regulators have the most effective tools available to identify and deal with such misconduct.' The Mail's investigation revealed that solicitor VP Lingajothy asked for £10,000 to invent a horrific back story to use in the asylum application. This included claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats that left him suicidal and compelled to flee to the UK. The legal adviser promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Home Secretary Suella Braverman (pictured), Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry and Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael were among politicians from all parties that had also called for legal authorities to investigate Two said they would falsely claim the Mail's reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers. Many of the law firm staff enjoy wealth and prestige, including Mr Lingajothy who owns a multi-million pound property empire with his wife, drives a BMW with personalised number plates and sent his son to Eton. But while immigrants face jail for making false asylum claims, solicitors who encourage, facilitate and profit from them merely face professional sanctions.

The first is we’re going to increase the charges that we have for migrants who are coming to this country when they apply for visas. “And indeed, something called the immigration health surcharge which is the levy that they pay to access the NHS. So all of those fees are going to go up and that will raise over a billion pounds.” The charity Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, claimed that the Government was treating people born outside the UK as “cash cows”.

He added: “I’m not shying away from that, because I think that’s the right thing to do.” Around half of the cost will be met by a rise of up to 20 per cent in visa fees and increasing the immigration health surcharge from £624 to £1,035. Whitehall departments will also have to “reprioritise” resources to help pay the rest of the bill. Mr Sunak insisted that was “not about cuts” but was “just about focusing on public sector workers’ pay rather than other things”. He added: “And I’m really pleased that the teaching unions specifically have said that this pay offer is properly funded.” The classroom unions said they would urge members to accept the offer, which would bring to an end months of strike action. In a joint statement the ASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU said: “A 6½ percent increase for teachers and school leaders recognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession.” They said the offer was “properly funded” and schools will receive extra cash for it. Union chiefs who will put the offer to members said: “This deal will allow teachers and school leaders to call off strike action and resume normal relations with Government.” But doctors’ leaders at the BMA said they feel they had “no option but to take industrial action” after years of below-inflation pay awards. Junior doctors, who yesterday began their longest walkout yet in England, will receive rises of six percent plus a £1,250 bonus.

More info Hospital consultants, due to strike in England next week, will be given six per cent too. Some doctors who are training will receive more than 10 percent. Mr Sunak insisted the awards will not be reviewed, even if some staff take further industrial action. He said: “There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year’s settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.” He urged consultants and junior doctors to accept the pay offer and warned strikes made it “far harder” for care backlogs to be cleared. The PM said the awards were based on recommendations from independent pay review bodies “which we have accepted in full”. He added: “I would urge them to accept this offer from the independent bodies. And that way we can all work collectively together to bring the backlogs down. I know that that’s what the vast majority of them want to see happen. “That’s what I want to see happen and I’m prepared to work with them to do that.” Professor Phil Banfield, the BMA’s chairman of council, called the offer “yet another pay cut in real terms and [it] serves only to increase the losses faced by doctors after more than a decade’s worth of sub-inflation pay awards.” Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the rise was fair: “It reflects the hugely important work that doctors do, and it’s an opportunity now for the NHS to move forward.” He denied the Government would make department cuts to fund the increases, saying the proposed immigration surcharge rise “better reflects the increased costs of providing NHS cover to those who come to the UK” and a “fair and reasonable approach”. He said the pay offer was final but added “My door is open to discuss other issues” with the BMA including working conditions in the NHS. Tory MP Steve Brine, the chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, paid credit to teaching unions “for recognising reality”.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. BY DOING SO, THEY ENSURED A VICTORY FOR LEAVE IN THE REFERENDUM OF 2016, PAVING THE WAY FOR A BREXIT THAT HAS ACHIEVED NOTHING OTHER THAN FURTHER REDUCING GROWTH AND LIVING STANDARDS, LEAVING 63% OF BRITONS TO CONCLUDE BREXIT WAS MORE OF A FAILURE THAN A SUCCESS, WITH JUST 12% SUGGESTING THE OPPOSITE. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration

In a letter to her successor Suella Braverman, Dame Priti said there had been an “alarming and staggering” lack of clarity about the plans for the former RAF base at Wethersfield in Essex. The site has been earmarked to house 1,700 asylum seekers by the autumn as part of Government plans to reduce the money spent on hotels. Dame Priti, whose Witham constituency is near the airfield, hit out after reports the site could be in use for five years. The first asylum seekers moved into the site in July. In her letter to Mrs Braverman and immigration minister Robert Jenrick, Dame Priti said she had asked a series of parliamentary questions but had received “no definitive answer”. “It is therefore concerning to now see that it appears that the Home Office has put in place plans to use the site for asylum accommodation for a five-year period and considers that this meets the value for money requirement,” she said. Dame Priti said the failure to provide a direct answer “gives the impression that the Home Office is being evasive”. The possibility of the site being used for five years to achieve value for money emerged in a leaked memo reported by the Daily Telegraph. DAME PRITI SUGGESTED THE GOVERNMENT WAS BEING “SECRETIVE ABOUT ITS INTENTIONS”.

The policy document written for the Cabinet — and leaked to The Sun — reveals a proposal for an emergency brake on visas to help cut the figure to levels promised in the Tories’ 2019 election manifesto. 1 Liz Truss rejected a proposal for an 'Emergency Brake' on visas to drive down legal entry rates Credit: Getty It included what were described as “deliberate frictions”, such as capping entry visas, raising fees and increasing salary thresholds, to regain control of Britain’s borders. Officials claimed there was a high probability that it would drive down immigration figures but warned there was a limited window to meet the 2019 promise by next year. The document, dated August 2022, quotes the Tories’ pledge — made when net migration stood at 225,000 — that overall numbers would come down. But it warned action needed to be taken immediately. Instead, The Sun understands, the plan was rejected by then PM Liz Truss. By May this year the net migration figure had rocketed to 606,000. Rishi Sunak is under pressure from his backbenches to do more to get net migration down. This week, 25 Tory backbenchers in the New Conservatives group published a 12-point plan to cut it to 400,000. MR SUNAK HAS MADE A MINOR TWEAK TO THE RIGHTS OF STUDENT DEPENDANTS TO COME TO THE UK — BUT THE REST OF THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN REVISITED. And a Government source says an increase in the £624 NHS surcharge paid by legal migrants to the UK was in the pipeline but any hope of meeting the manifesto commitment had now been missed. The Home Office plan had gone much further however — giving the Cabinet two options. One was to “pursue actions to reduce total inward migration”. It said: “This could include capping some routes, changing thresholds (skills/salary), restricting the rights of dependants, and/or reducing the attractiveness of the graduate visa.” The second option was not to make changes and instead to spin the line that “we have control of inward migration”. But it warned: “A strong narrative will be required to explain the rationale.” The document states the most effective policy lever would be an absolute cap or emergency brake and rated its certainty of success as high. But it warned there would be major effects on critical sectors of the economy that might be hard to defend. Raising the threshold of skills required to the UK was also deemed to be highly effective — but warned restrictions on the lowest-skilled visas was “overwhelmingly likely to impact health and care workers”. A Whitehall source said: “The plan was drawn up at official level during the transition from Boris to Liz. “The new PM rejected it and now it’s just sitting there gathering dust. The Treasury had kittens about it but if ministers actually wanted to get the numbers down, here is how they could.” A Home Office spokesman said: “We will continue to strike the right balance between supporting the UK economy through skilled worker visas and upholding our commitment to reduce migration over time.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22955955/liz-truss-axed-emergency-brake-visas-drive-down-migration/,http://web.archive.org/web/20240512153544/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22955955/liz-truss-axed-emergency-brake-visas-drive-down-migration/

New analysis shows the Government gave nearly £1.5billion to groups opposing its efforts to end the small boat crossings. It comes as ministers vowed to fight a Court of Appeal ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Saturday night: “Despite this judgement, our commitment to stopping the boats is as strong as ever.” On Saturday night it emerged the Church of England has also attacked the Government’s immigration policies, by accusing Ministers of creating a “boom market” for people smugglers. READ MORE: Rishi Sunak threatens war with Lords over plot to block illegal migrant bill [LATEST] Rwanda scheme foiled by £1.5bn of taxpayer's money In a briefing paper for MPs, bishops said: “Fees to traffickers and smugglers are not simply paid up-front, but often include conditional labour, entrapment and exploitation in the UK to work off the debt incurred from being trafficked. In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. THE COUNTRY HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF WELCOMING THOSE IN NEED. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania.

ALEX CHALK SAID THE UNIT, FOR WHICH THERE IS NO NEW FUNDING, WILL AIM TO ENSURE ADVOCATES WHO ARE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUBMITTING FRAUDULENT CLAIMS ARE “CONVICTED, PUNISHED AND DISGRACED”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed For Labour, shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said it is “too little too late” and the “buck stops” with the Conservatives, accusing them of having “sat idly by for 13 years while illegal migration has spun out of control”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. ADDRESSING MR ANDERSON’S ABSENCE, MR KRUGER SAID: “HE’S A VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY SO HE DOESN’T OFFICIALLY ENDORSE POLICY PROPOSALS TO THE PARTY, UNDERSTANDABLY. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” Ms Cates questioned the decision to keep care workers on the occupation shortage list, a designation that allows the sector to bring lower-skilled workers into the country to fill positions, suggesting it was a Covid policy that had not delivered. She said the country had “record levels of migration, and we’ve still not solved the care crisis”, with Ms Cates instead arguing that the solution was to “train up our own people to do the work” and “improve the pay conditions so that people want to do it”. Mr Kruger said the group, along with his party, were rallying against the “establishment” when it came to migration reforms. “There is an establishment in this country, which the Conservative leadership and our colleagues here are not part of, and that is the establishment that we’re fighting against, that resists these proposals, particularly on immigration,” he said. Downing Street said the Government had no plan to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list and downplayed the prospect of blocking foreign university students from staying in the UK after graduation – another recommendation made by the New Conservatives group. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to say whether Mr Sunak was frustrated by Mr Anderson’s support for tougher migration rules but acknowledged there were “different views on each side”. Home Secretary Suella Braverman faced a question from Tory MP James Daly in the Commons about raising the main skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 per annum, a recommendation made in Mr Hunt’s report. Mrs Braverman told him she recognised that “net migration is too high” and that overall numbers needed to be reduced. She earlier told MPs: “We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-prime-minister-lee-anderson-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230712025821/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-prime-minister-lee-anderson-b2368581.html

Recall that public sector workers in the UK, including teachers and health workers, have recently embarked on strikes demanding a pay increase across the country. SUNAK SAID IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO PRIORITISE PAYING PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS MORE, THE MONEY HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE HE IS NOT PREPARED TO INCREASE PEOPLE'S TAXES AND DOES NOT THINK IT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE OR RIGHT TO BORROW MORE AS IT WOULD ONLY WORSEN INFLATION. “So, what we have done are two things to find this money. The first is, we are going to increase the charges that we have for migrants who are coming to this country when they apply for visas, and indeed something called the immigration health surcharge (IHS), which is the levy that they pay to access the NHS,” Sunak added. According to the prime minister, an increase in fees is imminent, projecting a revenue boost of over one billion pounds. He noted that the proposed adjustments encompass a broad range of visa application fees, which are set to rise significantly. Similarly, the immigration health surcharge for legal migrants entering the country will be raised. “All of those fees are going to go up, and that will raise over a billion pounds. Across the board, visa application fees are going to go up significantly, and similarly for the immigration health surcharge for migrants who are coming to this country legally.”
  The Prime Minister had stated a few weeks earlier at the US embassy that he would be raising fees for processing non-immigrant visa (NIV) applications. According to a statement on the US embassy's website, the new fees for various visa categories will go into effect on Monday, June 17, 2023.",https://guardian.ng/news/uk-increases-visa-fees-health-charges-for-nigerians-other-immigrants/,http://web.archive.org/web/20241214121911/https://guardian.ng/news/uk-increases-visa-fees-health-charges-for-nigerians-other-immigrants/

The oldest asylum seeker yet discovered pretending to be a child was actually found to be 41, Robert Jenrick said. HE TOLD MPS THAT MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS - THOUGHT TO INCLUDE X-RAYS OR MRI SCANS - WILL INITIALLY RUN IN PARALLEL WITH EXISTING TESTS WHICH ARE BASED ON BEHAVIOURAL AND LANGUAGE STUDIES. ‘That will happen over the course of this year,’ Mr Jenrick told MPs in the Commons. ‘The oldest individual that we’ve encountered who posed as a child was subsequently found to be 41 years of age. ‘We do take the issue of age assessment extremely seriously. Scientific age assessments of migrants who claim to be children will start this year, the immigration minister Robert Jenrick confirmed today Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai (pictured) who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year ‘There are individuals who abuse the system - that’s wrong as a matter of principle but it’s also a serious safeguarding risk to genuine children. ‘It’s important that we weed out those cases of abuse because it poses such a risk. ‘I’m afraid we’ve seen some very tragic instances such as the murder that occurred in Bournemouth at the behest of somebody who had posed as a child.’ Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year. Abdulrahimzai was on the run from murder charges in Serbia when he arrived in Britain, and was later convicted in his absence of gunning down two people with a Kalashnikov assault rifle. The Home Office commissioned a report, published in January, which said migrants suspected of pretending to be children could undergo a range of medical tests to determine their true age. It recommended a combination of X-rays of the wisdom teeth and the hand or wrist, plus MRI scans of the knee or collarbone. The move may prove controversial because medics have opposed the use of X-rays for non-medical reasons. Other shocking cases in which adult asylum seekers claimed to be children include Ahmad Otak who in 2012 forced his ex-girlfriend to watch him murder her sister and her friend after she refused to take him back. Mr Roberts was murdered by Abdulrahimzai following an argument over a scooter in Bournemouth A court heard the Afghan lied about his age to get preferential treatment from social services, but Otak was actually 22. Others include Parson’s Green terrorist Ahmed Hassan, who posed as a 16-year-old before setting off a bomb on a Tube train in west London in 2017, injuring 23 people. A judge said he was satisfied the bomber was between 18 and 21. Other adult migrants have ended up in schools being taught alongside young teenage children. Migrants who claim to be under 18 receive better housing and support, a more sympathetic hearing in their asylum claim and are less likely to be detained. Under current rules, local authorities are not allowed to carry out physical examinations of asylum seekers suspected of lying about their age. Instead, social workers estimate the person’s age by assessing their behaviour and language skills. In 2021 the British Dental Association said it ‘vigorously opposed’ using dental X-rays to establish asylum seekers’ ages.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Mr Jenrick sparked controversy after allegedly ordering the removal of the murals at the centre in Kent, which depicted characters such as Baloo from The Jungle Book and Mickey Mouse. Initial reports suggested this was because it was deemed “too welcoming”. But speaking in response to Labour’s Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, Mr Jenrick on Tuesday claimed in the Commons the “set up” in the centre was altered because most of the children in the centre were teenagers. Ms Cooper asked: “Can he explain: is it true that he gave orders to the asylum reception centre to paint over children’s cartoons? “If so, why? BECAUSE NOBODY BELIEVES THAT MICKEY MOUSE CARTOONS EITHER ENCOURAGE OR DETER BOATS TO ARRIVE, AND THEY SIMPLY THINK THAT THIS IS THE MINISTER ACTUALLY NOT SHOWING SOME COMMON DECENCY TO VULNERABLE CHILDREN.” HE REPLIED: “WE PROVIDE VERY HIGH QUALITY CARE AT ALL OF THE CENTRES IN WHICH WE SUPPORT UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. “We didn’t think that the set-up in that particular unit was age appropriate because the majority of those individuals who were unaccompanied passing through it last year were teenagers. “That does not change the fundamentals that we support anyone who comes to this country with decency and compassion.” The story was first reported by the I newspaper, which reported that staff at the centre were “horrified"" by the ""cruel order”. In the Lords on Monday, Home Office Minister Lord Murray told peers that artworks weren’t initially commissioned by the Home Office. “It’s clearly the correct decision that these facilities have the requisite decoration befitting of their purpose,” he said. Among those criticising the department’s stance was Tory donor Lord Brownlow, who said he was “quite frankly ashamed” of the minister’s answer. It comes as MPs debate amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter people from crossing the Channel by toughening up the rules and conditions around seeking asylum. Peers in the House of Lords placed some 20 amendments to the bill, the majority of which are expected to be rejected by Tory MPs. However, ministers have offered to limit detention periods for children and pregnant women in a bid to get the bill passed.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-mickey-mouse-murals-illegal-migration-bill-commons-b1093687.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230718131918/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-mickey-mouse-murals-illegal-migration-bill-commons-b1093687.html

The Home Office said the unit would bring together regulatory bodies, law enforcement teams and other government departments to take action against advocates found to be deceiving the courts. It comes after the Daily Mail reported that a number of solicitors agreed to help an undercover journalist posing as an economic migrant submit a false application in exchange for thousands of pounds. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice. Home Secretary Suella Braverman But the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. It added the Home Office is focusing on a “tiny minority of lawyers” rather than “significant” asylum claim backlogs and “the unworkability of the Illegal Migration Act”. The Home Office said the Professional Enablers Taskforce, for which there is no new funding, had been carrying out preliminary work over the past few months. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity, according to the department. Police referrals have also been made where criminal activity is suspected, the Home Office said. The announcement came after the first 15 migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. CONSERVATIVE PARTY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN LEE ANDERSON WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID ASYLUM SEEKERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BARGE, MOORED OFF THE DORSET COAST, SHOULD “F*** OFF BACK TO FRANCE”. Home secretary Suella Braverman, speaking about the task force, said: “Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice. “While the majority of lawyers act with integrity – we know that some are lying to help illegal migrants game the system. It is not right or fair on those who play by the rules. “The British people want us to put an end to illegal migration – I am determined to crack down on these immoral lawyers and stop the boats.” Speaking to the Daily Mail, Ms Braverman said: “These conmen make it far harder to remove people who have no right to be here – and they must face the full force of the law. “I want to see the worst offenders in jail and we have the laws in place to bring them to justice. “I know our teams are working incredibly hard to root out those who game our asylum system and cheat the British public – this can’t go on.” Justice secretary Alex Chalk said: “The accuracy and honesty of legal advice underpins the integrity of our world-leading legal system, so those who undermine it by encouraging deception must be held to account. “This government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.” But Richard Atkinson, deputy vice president of the Law Society, said: “This ‘task force’ has been around for months now, so it is not clear what, if anything, the government is announcing today.” He added: “The government, regulators and law enforcement agencies already have the powers they need to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. “The overwhelming majority of immigration lawyers continue to support the rule of law through their adherence to the law and professional standards set by the Solicitors Regulation Authority and provide an essential service to clients. “The focus of the Home Office on a tiny minority of lawyers to which they are apparently applying considerable resources should not deflect from the fact that there remains significant backlogs in asylum claims or the unworkability of the Illegal Migration Act.” Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system. Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC said lawyers must observe ethical and conduct rules which apply to them while advising and representing their clients, with appropriate sanctions if they breach them. He said: “The task force must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers.” For Labour, shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said it was “too little too late” and the “buck stops” with the Conservatives, accusing them of having “sat idly by for 13 years while illegal migration has spun out of control”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” The first asylum seekers arrived at the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland on Monday, with the Home Office saying people are expected to be housed there for between three to nine months.

He has previously held key positions at Avon and Somerset Police and West Midlands Police. 'Protecting the integrity of the UK's immigration system is vital, so it is an honour to be appointed to this important role,' Mr Javid said. 'I am excited to begin leading a group of dedicated, hard-working and talented public servants to ensure we uphold our rules and laws.' According to the Home Office, immigration enforcement visits are at their highest since 2019 and are up by almost 50 per cent on last year. Mrs Braverman said: 'Immigration abuse is a scourge on our society and I will leave no stone unturned in clamping down on this illegality. 'Bas brings a wealth of law enforcement experience and will further ramp up our efforts to tackle immigration offending, as the British people would expect.' Home Office permanent secretary Sir Matthew Rycroft, the department's most senior official, also welcomed the appointment. He said he looked forward to welcoming Mr Javid to the Home Office and working alongside him to 'tackle illegal migration, which is the top priority for the department'. The Home Office stressed Mr Javid's appointment was overseen by the Civil Service Commission, which regulates senior civil service recruitment and 'followed a rigorous, fair and open competition'.

He served in a range of ministerial roles in David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson's governments. This included his spell as Mrs May's home secretary, as well as Chancellor and then health secretary under Mr Johnson. The Javid brothers also include a top property investor, a supermarket chain boss, and a financial adviser. Tragedy struck in 2018 when the eldest Javid sibling, Tariq, took his own life. Sajid recently spoke of how he still wonders if 'there's anything I could have done' to save his brother's life. The Javid brothers' parents moved to Britain from the Punjab in the 1960s to Rochdale, Lancashire, before moving to Bristol where they lived in a two-bedroom flat. Sajid shared a room with his parents along with one of his other brothers. He has previously spoken of being a six-year-old interpreter for his Pakistani mother, who did not speak English for many years after arriving in Britain.

The gender section of the memo tells employees: “Avoid using ‘men and women’ - say ‘people’ or ‘Londoners’. “Similarly, instead of ‘ladies and gentlemen’ say something that doesn’t exclude non-binary people.” It says the terms male and female are “dated and medicalised” and that “female humans are called ‘girls and/or women’, male humans are called ‘boys and/or men’”.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. THE AVERAGE BRITON IS SET TO BE NO BETTER OFF IN 2026 THAN THEY WERE IN 2008, AND THE POOREST FIFTH ARE MORE THAN 20% POORER THAN THEIR FRENCH AND GERMAN COUNTERPARTS. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders.

A leaked policy document has shown the UK's shortest-lived PM had drawn up a proposal to introduce an emergency brake on visas to realise the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto goals on migration. The policy had also reportedly included other measures making it harder for people to settle in the country, even via legal routes. The document, obtained by The Sun, outlined a selection of so-called “deliberate frictions” including proposals for raising fees and increasing salary thresholds for migrants. The publication said officials claimed there was a ""high probability"" the policy would drive immigration figures down, but that there was a limited application window to meet the 2019 targets. BORIS JOHNSON'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 2019 ON A PROMISE TO CUT IMMIGRATION OVERALL, WITH THEN-HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL SAYING: “ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BREXIT IS THAT WE GET TO TAKE BACK CONTROL AND MAKE OUR SYSTEM FAIRER. ""A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one."" The document suggested that the most effective policy lever would be to introduce an absolute cap or emergency brake on visas, but while the rate of success was deemed high, it could introduce significant effects on the economy. Alternatively, it suggested the Government could instead introduce a new spin, and have ministers insist: “We have control of inward migration”. A Whitehall source told the Sun that the document was drawn up during the Johnson-Truss transition ""at official level"", but it was ultimately rejected by Ms Truss. They added it is now ""sitting there gathering dust"" and claimed it was viable for tackling the growing number of incoming immigrants. Rishi Sunak is now under significant pressure from within his party to tackle migration, with the net figure having reached 606,000 this year. A Home Office spokesman said: “We will continue to strike the right balance between supporting the UK economy through skilled worker visas and upholding our commitment to reduce migration over time.”",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1788370/liz-truss-scrapped-migration-reduction-as-prime-minister

Pictured, a group being brought ashore in Kent last month Robert Jenrick today slammed the asylum system as 'riddled with abuse' as he defended making arrivals share hotel rooms Mr Jenrick said a lot of progress has been made on illegal migration in a short period of time, with 'really unique landmark deals' with France seeing a 'big increase' in the number of interceptions on the beaches. But he told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: 'The asylum system is riddled with abuse, we have to be honest with ourselves. 'The way to tackle that is by changing fundamentally the way we handle asylum.' Mr Jenrick said the Illegal Migration Bill to detain migrants who arrive through unauthorised means before returning them home or to a third country, such as Rwanda, will alleviate the pressure. 'That will create the deterrent we desperately need, it will break the business model of the people smuggle gangs and it will stop the system from coming under intolerable pressure like it is today,' he said. Mr Jenrick said he did not think it was unreasonable to ask asylum seekers to share rooms after a group this week apparently refused to enter a Pimlico hotel where the Home Office had asked them to sleep 'four people per room'. In a letter to the Home Secretary, the leader of Westminster City Council expressed his 'deep concern' that around 40 refugees were placed in the borough on Wednesday night 'without appropriate accommodation or support available' and no prior communication with the local authority. Mr Jenrick said: 'As I understand what happened here was that these migrants, who had themselves said that they were destitute, they had nowhere to stay, we had offered them a safe bed with board and lodgings in a good-quality hotel in central London. 'Yes, some of them had to share with other people. These are single adult males: I don't think that's unreasonable. 'We want to reduce the cost to the taxpayer. Some people said that wasn't good enough and they wanted their own ensuite bedrooms, and the Home Office took the perfectly reasonable view that we've got to look after the taxpayer here. 'And if you're genuinely destitute, of course you'd accept that, and common sense prevailed and, I think, almost all of the migrants in question accepted the accommodation.' Rishi Sunak has made 'stopping the boats' one of his key pledges ahead of the general election due next year He denied it was Government policy to tell asylum seekers they have to share four to a room in hotels, but said it was 'completely fair and reasonable' to ask single adult males to share a room. 'We don't want to be using hotels at all. These are taking away valuable assets for the local business community, for society, you know, people's weddings and personal events have had to be cancelled because of that. 'But where we are using them, it's right that we get good value for money for the taxpayer. 'And so if single adult males can share a room, and it's legal to do so, which will obviously depend on the size of the accommodation, then we'll ask people to do that. 'I think that's a completely fair and reasonable approach,' he told Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg. Mr Jenrick said people arriving in small boats 'risk cannibalising the compassion' of the UK public. He also told Sophy Ridge On Sunday on Sky News that young men putting 'overwhelming pressure' on the asylum system are making it harder for the country to support people who 'genuinely need our help'.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12157379/Immigration-minister-slams-abuse-riddled-asylum-system.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12157379/Immigration-minister-slams-abuse-riddled-asylum-system.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept.

But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'Its funds were put at risk, and there was serious misconduct and/or mismanagement by the former trustees.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'AS WITH CERTAIN IMMIGRATION LAWYERS, IT'S CLEAR THAT SOME CHARITIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS ARE ACTIVELY UNDERMINING EFFORTS TO CURB ILLEGAL MIGRATION. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets. I always followed the advice of our lawyers, accountants and auditors in the running of Care4Calais.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

An investigation was launched into Care4Calais in August 2020, amid concerns about payments to connected parties, detailed in the charity’s accounts. The regulator also identified concerns around whether those acting as charity trustees were validly appointed, and raised questions about former trustees’ decision-making. The Charity Commission has now said Care4Calais lacked requisite governance structures, had poor internal financial controls, and inadequately handled complaints. The group sparked outrage earlier this month after they claimed responsibility for stopping 20 migrants from being sent to the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset. READ MORE: Tory fury after left wing charity blocks migrants boarding the Bibby Stockholm Care4Calais prevented 20 migrants from boarding the Bibby Stockholm earlier this month Care4Calais released a statement on August 8 boasting: “None of the asylum seekers we are supporting have gone to the Bibby Stockholm today as legal representatives have had their transferred cancelled”.

Between October 2017 and August 2020, payments of over £340,000 were made to a personal bank account belonging to one of Care4Calais’ now-former trustees, leading to the commission using its powers to restrict financial transactions between the charity and current or former trustees. The commission concluded that the transfer of cash was inappropriate, but did not see evidence funds had been misused or misappropriated for the ex-trustee’s private benefit. They also found that between 2020 and 2021, Care4Calais operated with just two trustees - below the minimum number stipulated in its governing document. This was found to be misconduct and/or mismanagement. SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

HMT Empire Windrush docked in Britain on June 22, 1948, and marked the beginning of a wave of immigration that helped repair post-war Britain. That generation and their contribution to the UK will be celebrated across the country. What is the Windrush generation? It started with around 500 Caribbeans paying about £28 (£1,040 in today’s money) to travel to Britain in response to job adverts in local newspapers. Having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948, they left a sunnier climate to seek greater opportunities in the UK, which was facing a labour shortage after the Second World War. They exited the vessel on June 22, 1948, having arrived the day before. The thousands who followed from colonies in the West Indies until 1971 became known as the Windrush generation. The 14,651 ton British troopship the Empire Windrush at Southampton / PA Wire Who was on the ship? Jamaicans, Bermudans, and Trinidadians were among those on board. Some had fought for Britain during the war and many would go on to fill roles in the UK — including as cooks, nurses, engineers, carpenters, and mechanics. One passenger was Sam “Mr Windrush” King, who became the first black mayor of Southwark in London and co-founded the Notting Hill Carnival. Another was Lord Woodbine, a calypso musician whose real name was Harold Philips. He would be described as the “sixth Beatle” for his mentorship of the band during their fledgling years. Windrush oral histories clip What about those who followed? Many who pursued the pioneering group on the Windrush went on to be key workers staffing the NHS, which also began its journey in 1948. The generation came to a close with the 1971 Immigration Act, legislation guaranteeing the right of those already settled in the UK to remain indefinitely. After that, a British passport-holder born overseas could only reside in the UK if they had a work permit and could also prove they had a parent or grandparent born in the UK. A Black man walking past graffiti stating 'Powell For PM’, referring to British Conservative politician Enoch Powell who caused controversy with his outspoken attitude to black immigration / Evening Standard / Getty Images What was the ‘Windrush scandal’? In 2018, it emerged that some from the Windrush generation were facing deportation and being denied access to healthcare, work, housing benefits, and pensions. They had the legal right to reside in the UK, but could not necessarily prove they had been in the country near-continuously, as new laws demand. Windrush Portrait of a Generation Many believed they had an automatic right to citizenship so had not got the paperwork. Some had arrived as children on a parent’s passport and officials admitted thousands of landing card slips recording their entry had been destroyed, eliminating vital evidence. How did the Government respond? Then Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who took a softer approach / Joe Giddens/PA Wire Then prime minister, Theresa May said she was “genuinely sorry” for the anxiety caused. AMBER RUDD WAS FORCED OUT AS HOME SECRETARY AND REPLACED BY SAJID JAVID, WHO VOWED TO ENSURE THOSE CAUGHT UP WOULD BE TREATED WITH “DECENCY AND FAIRNESS” AND SIGNALLED A SOFTER APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION POLICY. The Government went on to announce an annual Windrush Day to “recognise and honour the enormous contribution” of those who disembarked at Tilbury 70 years earlier. How will the 75th anniversary be celebrated? A group known as the Windrush 75 network has committed to making it an entire year of marking the anniversary. They say: “The 75th anniversary of the Windrush arriving in the UK is a Diamond Jubilee for modern, diverse Britain – when we mark an important moment in British history and come together to celebrate four generations of contribution, legacy, struggle, and positive change.” A host of events are being planned, including question and answer sessions with people and their families who came over, art installations, and dance events. The full list of events can be found here. What events are taking place in London? A photograph exhibition entitled Journeys to Hope started in January and finishes in September at Rivington Place near Farringdon. The outside exhibition can be seen at any time and is free, showing the journeys from an array of historic snapshots in time. Lenny Henry is also putting on a one-man show in his playwriting debut at the Bush Theatre near Kensington. Entitled August in England, it tells the story of a Windrush worker. The play finishes on June 10, and there are still some limited tickets available here. Trevor Nelson will also host a night of music at the Royal Albert Hall this Friday (June 9), at the Royal Albert Hall Presents Windrush 75 event.

Mrs Braverman will today chair a meeting with her Cabinet colleague Alex Chalk (pictured), the Solicitors Regulation Authority watchdog and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner to herald the new crackdown Mr Chalk, who is the Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, said: 'The accuracy and honesty of legal advice underpins the integrity of our world-leading legal system, so those who undermine it by encouraging deception must be held to account. 'This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.' The Mail's investigation led to the SRA suspending three legal firms caught offering to lodge fake asylum applications. The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Two said they would falsely claim that the undercover reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers. Mrs Braverman said last night: 'Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice. While the majority of lawyers act with integrity, we know that some are lying to help illegal migrants game the system. It is not right or fair on those who play by the rules.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the Government must clamp down on attractive pull factors to prevent the UK being seen as a “soft touch”. People smugglers will often promise migrants jobs and housing if they pay them thousands of pounds to risk their lives and cross the English channel in flimsy dinghies. Mr Jenrick declared last night: “Making it harder for illegal migrants to work and operate in the UK is vital to deterring dangerous, unnecessary boat crossings. “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue. “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks, and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties.” Employers face fines of up to £45,000 for every illegal migrant they help - triple the previous amount of £15,000. Bosses who have been caught harbouring illegal migrants before could be hit with a £60,000 penalty for every worker who does not have the right to remain in the UK. Government officials say more must be done to prevent UK being seen as 'soft touch' The fines for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes will also rocket, the Home Office confirmed last night. Landlords will be fined £5,000 for every lodger and £10,000 for every occupier of a property. This will double for any repeat offenders. It was previously £80 per lodger and £1,000 for every occupier. The Home Office last night revealed 4,000 employers have been hit with civil penalties since 2018. But only 230 landlords have been fined for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes from them over the same five year period. Officials stated: “Increasing fines will deter employers and landlords from engaging in these illegal and dangerous practices, further deterring people from attempting to come to the UK illegally.” Migrants believe they will face harsher punishments in France than they will in UK, says Mr Jenrick Mr Jenrick told GB News: “We are [reducing the pull factors]. “That’s exactly the work I have been doing over the last six months with Suella Braverman. We have changed the accommodation people are staying in. “The Labour Party say they don’t like us using disused military sites and barges. My post bag from Labour MPs is claiming the accommodation is not luxurious enough. “I think we have to make sure the UK is not perceived to be a soft touch. “THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE COMING IN SMALL BOATS ARE COMING FROM FRANCE, FROM A SAFE COUNTRY WITH A WELL FUNCTIONING ASYLUM SYSTEM. “They are choosing to come to the UK and that must be in part because of the perception that the UK is a softer touch. “That is why we are changing accommodation. That is why we are making it harder to live and work illegally in the UK with a 50 per cent rise in the number of raids this year to try and close down bogus employers.” SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Jenrick admitted: “We’re in conversation with a number of other ports and hoping that we can secure those very soon. “It's true that a couple of ports did back out, mostly because local Labour councils like in Birkenhead and in Leith in Edinburgh refused to support us, hypocritically actually if you look at the Leith example. “That's a Labour council that housed Ukrainian refugees on the same barge, same boat, but refused to house asylum seekers, all the time saying that they are a city of sanctuary.” Some 15,121 migrants have crossed the English Channel this year. But ministers and Border Force are braced for a surge in crossings as the weather improves this week. Trending Friday’s arrivals were the first since July 26 amid wind and rain in the Channel. Home Secretary Suella Braverman yesterday admitted that it is “going to be a tough Summer” as the weather improves. Mrs Braverman said: “I look closely at what the incoming flows are like, and we still have too many people coming across the Channel. We still need to honour our pledge to the British people to stop the boats.” But the Home Secretary refused to say whether the Government will stop the boats before the next election.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1799369/No10-to-punish-hiding-illegal-migrants,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1799369/No10-to-punish-hiding-illegal-migrants

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" from crossing the English Channel as one of his five pledges after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of hundreds of migrants in hotels after record numbers arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. The opposition Labour Party said Sunak had failed to clear the backlog of tens of thousands of asylum claims and that 7,600 people had crossed the English Channel so far this year - a total that is likely to increase over the summer months. Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving and a toughening of the country's stance on immigration can produce results. He said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country and that London was increasing its provision of accommodation for those awaiting immigration decisions. He said the government had secured two new vessels to house migrants to move them out of hotels. Sunak said so far this year, ""the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%"" and that Britain was now accepting one in 50 Albanian asylum cases compared with one in five previously. HE URGED PARLIAMENT TO PASS HIS NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR THE SWIFT DETENTION AND DEPORTATION OF PEOPLE ARRIVING ON SMALL BOATS BACK TO THEIR HOMELAND OR TO SO-CALLED SAFE THIRD COUNTRIES SUCH AS RWANDA. It is now in the upper house of parliament, where peers could try to weaken some its provisions. ""This won't be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it's so important that we change the law,"" he said. ""My policy is very simple: it is this country - and your government - who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. I will do what is necessary to achieve it. I said I would stop the boats and I meant it.""

In 2021, the figure was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. A month ago, Rishi Sunak delivered a major speech, insisting small boat crossings were down 20 percent since he unveiled his illegal crossings plan five months earlier. However, he received criticism at the time as the fall had been caused by a windy first few months to 2023, which had driven crossings down. Mr Sunak boasted that his 'plan is working' Nigel Farage warned Mr Sunak that his hubris would be undermined when the wind dropped, and said the fact numbers of migrants were up in Europe should have been a cause for concern in Downing Stree. The record-high June figures include 155 migrants who arrived in three boats on Friday. Records began five years ago. Mr Sunak said stopping the boats was one of “the people’s priorities”, and vowed to “rebuild trust in politics through action, or not at all”.

Then a solicitor, he travelled to the country on a 2008 trip for Tory MPs and party members, including future home secretary Suella Braverman. Mr Jenrick, who has been criticised for allegedly ordering staff to paint over cheerful paintings at an asylum unit for children, was elected to parliament six years later and now has a leading role implementing the Rwanda migration deal. After it was ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal last week, Mr Jenrick fiercely defended the policy, telling MPs it was “categorically untrue” that asylum seekers were at risk in the country. The court heard that Rwandan police shot at least 12 refugees dead during a 2018 protest over food shortages, and that more recently authorities had turned away Afghan and Syrian asylum seekers. The Court of Appeal judgment called Rwanda “a one-party state which reacts unfavourably to dissent”, but Mr Jenrick told parliament he had travelled there himself and added: “It is a country that is safe and where we have a good working relationship. “As soon as we have the ability to do so through the courts, we will get those flights off to Rwanda.” His two-week visit in 2008 was part of Project Umubano, which was described on its website as “the Conservative Party’s social action project in Rwanda and Sierra Leone” and ran from 2007 to 2017. Other future and current MPs involved included Jeremy Hunt, Tobias Ellwood, Desmond Swayne, Rob Halfon, Damian Hinds, Mark Pawsey, Maggie Throup, Wendy Morton and Pauline Latham. President Kagame is understood to have attended some events and told a local newspaper Project Umubano was “meaningful and will help people back in the UK understand Rwanda better”. It was led by international development minister Andrew Mitchell, who told The Independent: “Mr Jenrick used his legal skills to great effect as part of the Conservative Party’s social action partnership, Project Umubano, working with lawyers in Rwanda.” The project focused on five areas, with the justice pillar seeing 12 lawyers and volunteers including Ms Braverman and Mr Jenrick run workshops in the Rwandan government’s Ministry of Justice and at a university. Rwandan president Paul Kagame with Conservative MP Andrew Mitchel during a celebration for the 10th anniversary of Project Umubano, Kigali, 11 August 2017 (Paul Kagame/CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) An article written by Mr Mitchell at the time said they would cover the “English legal system and international treaties”. Steve Smith MBE, chief executive of refugee charity Care4Calais, said that both the immigration minister and home secretary’s previous trips to Rwanda “raise serious questions about the government’s decision to continue pursuing their brutal, immoral and expensive policy”. “The Court of Appeal ruling was clear - Rwanda is not a safe country to remove refugees to,” he added. “Yet Ms Braverman and Mr Jenrick continue to assert that it is, offering no evidence other than the Rwandan government’s hollow assurances. PEOPLE WILL RIGHTLY BE WONDERING WHY THEY CONTINUE TO PURSUE THIS POLICY, AND WHY OUR GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SQUANDER MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF PUBLIC MONEY WHEN IT HAS BEEN RULED UNLAWFUL.” ALISTAIR CARMICHAEL, THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS’ HOME AFFAIRS SPOKESPERSON, SAID: “MINISTERS LIKE ROBERT JENNRICK SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO OWN THIS UNWORKABLE, INEFFECTIVE AND EXPENSIVE POLICY. What’s worst is his boss Suella Braverman seems intent on taking the Home Office to the brink trying to follow through with it.” The Independent could not find any public record of Mr Jenrick discussing the trip, but Ms Braverman co-wrote an article under her maiden name Suella Fernandes in December 2008. It said volunteer lawyers aimed to “regenerate Rwanda’s legal system” following the 1994 genocide, by working with the Kagame government’s Ministry of Justice and a state-funded law school. UK government's Rwanda asylum plan is unlawful, says Court of Appeal The article suggested that Rwanda did not have a “properly functioning legal system”, and said there was an “almost total absence of what we as UK lawyers often take for granted”. A source close to Mr Jenrick said: “The immigration minister visited Rwanda on a volunteering trip as a private citizen before he became an MP, helping to train lawyers at a Rwandan university. “He would highly recommend other young people take opportunities to see the world and make a contribution whenever they can.” His role in Project Umubano is not believed to have fallen under any disclosure requirement under the ministerial code. Ms Braverman was a barrister and Conservative Party election candidate at the time of her involvement, and went on to co-found and direct a charity delivering training to Rwandan government lawyers. She did not formally disclose five years of work with the Africa Justice Foundation to the Home Office but Rishi Sunak refused to trigger an inquiry after The Independent revealed the link in May. Ms Braverman resigned from her post as director weeks before being elected as an MP, by which time Rwandan media reported that 19 alumni were serving in government institutions including the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister and Ministry of Justice. A spokesperson for the home secretary previously said she had not disclosed her involvement in the Africa Justice Foundation because it was not necessary, and that she did not make any submissions to colleagues on the country’s suitability for an asylum deal.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rwanda-deal-robert-jenrick-braverman-b2368368.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240710002159/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rwanda-deal-robert-jenrick-braverman-b2368368.html

The shadow immigration minister, Stephen Kinnock, said the idea makes him “deeply unhappy” as it is the last thing the party wants to do. But he said Labour would have “no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit”. Kinnock told Sky News on Sunday: “Over the last 13 years, the Tory government has destroyed our asylum system. We’ll inherit a mess if we are privileged to win the next election.” When pressed if that meant Labour would continue to use the barges to house asylum seekers, Kinnock said: “The reality is, on day one we will have to deal with the we have and the shambolic mess they have left us. We’ll be left with no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit.” He told BBC Breakfast that he was confident a Labour government could get on top of the backlog within six months. The shadow minister refused to give a timeline on when a Labour government would stop using the barges and bring down the backlog from a record high of more than 172,000 cases.

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph Dowden criticised those who have expressed concern over the asylum seeker barge, urging them to stop their “howls of outrage”. The government is to launch a series of immigration policies this week in an effort to show the prime minister is starting to get a grip on one of his five key priorities – to “stop the boats”. Kinnock, speaking on Sunday morning, also accused the Conservatives of “cooking the books” to show they were getting a grip on the spiralling asylum backlog. “They have been artificially withdrawing claims if someone misses an appointment. It doesn’t mean they’ve been processed, it just puts people into limbo. Then essentially people are just slipping into the underground economy,” Kinnock said.

The Prime Minister ruled out more borrowing and tax rises as ways to fund the £2billion package. Mr Sunak said: “What we have done are two things to find this money. The first is we’re going to increase the charges that we have for migrants who are coming to this country when they apply for visas. “AND INDEED, SOMETHING CALLED THE IMMIGRATION HEALTH SURCHARGE WHICH IS THE LEVY THAT THEY PAY TO ACCESS THE NHS. So all of those fees are going to go up and that will raise over a billion pounds.” The charity Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, claimed that the Government was treating people born outside the UK as “cash cows”. Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz, its public affairs manager, said raising “already eye-wateringly high” visa fees risks seeing people fall deeper into poverty and insecurity. But Mr Sunak said choices had to be made over funding public sector pay rises. He added: “I’m not shying away from that, because I think that’s the right thing to do.” Around half of the cost will be met by a rise of up to 20 per cent in visa fees and increasing the immigration health surcharge from £624 to £1,035. Whitehall departments will also have to “reprioritise” resources to help pay the rest of the bill. Mr Sunak insisted that was “not about cuts” but was “just about focusing on public sector workers’ pay rather than other things”. He added: “And I’m really pleased that the teaching unions specifically have said that this pay offer is properly funded.” The classroom unions said they would urge members to accept the offer, which would bring to an end months of strike action. In a joint statement the ASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU said: “A 6½ percent increase for teachers and school leaders recognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession.” They said the offer was “properly funded” and schools will receive extra cash for it. Union chiefs who will put the offer to members said: “This deal will allow teachers and school leaders to call off strike action and resume normal relations with Government.” But doctors’ leaders at the BMA said they feel they had “no option but to take industrial action” after years of below-inflation pay awards.

More info Hospital consultants, due to strike in England next week, will be given six per cent too. Some doctors who are training will receive more than 10 percent. Mr Sunak insisted the awards will not be reviewed, even if some staff take further industrial action. He said: “There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year’s settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.” He urged consultants and junior doctors to accept the pay offer and warned strikes made it “far harder” for care backlogs to be cleared. The PM said the awards were based on recommendations from independent pay review bodies “which we have accepted in full”. He added: “I would urge them to accept this offer from the independent bodies. And that way we can all work collectively together to bring the backlogs down. I know that that’s what the vast majority of them want to see happen. “That’s what I want to see happen and I’m prepared to work with them to do that.” Professor Phil Banfield, the BMA’s chairman of council, called the offer “yet another pay cut in real terms and [it] serves only to increase the losses faced by doctors after more than a decade’s worth of sub-inflation pay awards.” Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the rise was fair: “It reflects the hugely important work that doctors do, and it’s an opportunity now for the NHS to move forward.” He denied the Government would make department cuts to fund the increases, saying the proposed immigration surcharge rise “better reflects the increased costs of providing NHS cover to those who come to the UK” and a “fair and reasonable approach”. He said the pay offer was final but added “My door is open to discuss other issues” with the BMA including working conditions in the NHS.

The shadow immigration minister, Stephen Kinnock, said the idea makes him “deeply unhappy” as it is the last thing the party wants to do. But he said Labour would have “no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit”. KINNOCK TOLD SKY NEWS ON SUNDAY: “OVER THE LAST 13 YEARS, THE TORY GOVERNMENT HAS DESTROYED OUR ASYLUM SYSTEM. We’ll inherit a mess if we are privileged to win the next election.” When pressed if that meant Labour would continue to use the barges to house asylum seekers, Kinnock said: “The reality is, on day one we will have to deal with the we have and the shambolic mess they have left us. We’ll be left with no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit.” He told BBC Breakfast that he was confident a Labour government could get on top of the backlog within six months. The shadow minister refused to give a timeline on when a Labour government would stop using the barges and bring down the backlog from a record high of more than 172,000 cases. Kinnock’s comments came as the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said checks were still taking place on a controversial barge designed to house asylum seekers, with the first group due to be housed there within “weeks”. He said was confident the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, would become operational soon and that the government was taking into account concerns over fire safety. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph Dowden criticised those who have expressed concern over the asylum seeker barge, urging them to stop their “howls of outrage”. The government is to launch a series of immigration policies this week in an effort to show the prime minister is starting to get a grip on one of his five key priorities – to “stop the boats”. Kinnock, speaking on Sunday morning, also accused the Conservatives of “cooking the books” to show they were getting a grip on the spiralling asylum backlog. “They have been artificially withdrawing claims if someone misses an appointment. It doesn’t mean they’ve been processed, it just puts people into limbo. Then essentially people are just slipping into the underground economy,” Kinnock said. More than 6,000 people have been wiped off the list without being fully assessed in just three months, for reasons such as failing to attend interviews or appointments, and not filling in new fast-track questionnaires, the Independent reported.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/06/labour-would-barges-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-stephen-kinnock,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/06/labour-would-barges-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-stephen-kinnock

THE LABOUR POLITICIAN SAID IT WAS 'REASONABLE' FOR PEOPLE TO 'RESENT' THE IDEA THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CIRCUMVENT THE SYSTEM IF YOU ARE 'YOUNG, ABLE BODIED' AND WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY A PEOPLE SMUGGLER. Sir Trevor, who previously served as head of the Commission for Racial Equality, said most people from a migrant background took this view because they had personally followed the rules. He warned against treating all immigrants as if they were a 'single mass' and said not enough effort was being put into identifying those who were in the country illegally. 'We've got to find who the illegal immigrants are – we're now talking about upwards of a million people – very little effort is going into that, because actually, it benefits quite a lot of people,' Sir Trevor told the Telegraph. Sir Trevor Phillips said it was 'reasonable' for people to 'resent' the idea that it was possible to circumvent the system if you are 'young, able bodied' and with enough money to pay a people smuggler 'Secondly, once you have found illegal immigrants, they should be treated fairly. Most people of a migrant background will take that view because most of us did it the hard way.

He is now hosting his own current affairs show, Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, which launches on Sky at 8.30am on September 3. Sir Trevor, previously served as chair of the London Assembly, also stressed the importance of people from different ethnic groups mixing with each other rather than living in separate communities. He questioned whether the British model of multiculturalism was working when in some towns and cities people would mix together at work but in the evenings go back to areas 'in which everybody who lives there are people like themselves'. He listed Burney, Preston and Leicester and some towns in the North West as examples of this phenomenon. The number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the Channel recently topped 20,000.

The Home Office recently announced that cross-Channel migrants could be forced to wear electronic tags.

Any attempt to remove the tag and abscond would result in any right to bail or to remain in the UK being automatically withdrawn.

Ministers reacted with fury to the Court of Appeal verdict in favour of several asylum seekers and a charity fighting against the Government policy. Campaigners called for the Government to drop its plans to send asylum applicants to Rwanda following the court ruling that the plan to deport migrants was unlawful amid concerns over the east African nation's asylum system. In a majority decision, judges overturned an earlier High Court ruling that said Rwanda could be considered a “safe third country”. The Government said it would seek to appeal against the ruling, with the Prime Minister saying he “fundamentally” disagreed with the decision.

The decision is the latest setback in Mr Sunak’s bid to “stop the boats” – one of his flagship pledges. Ms Braverman insisted that she still had “every confidence” in the plan while stressing that Rwanda was a safe country. Suella Braverman has vowed to continue with her asylum policy When asked if she blamed “lefty lawyers” or “the blob” amid the defeat, she told broadcasters: “The system is rigged against the British people, it’s as simple as that. “IT’S WHY WE’RE CHANGING THE LAWS THROUGH OUR ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL.” SHE THEN DOUBLED DOWN ON HER CLAIMS IN THE COMMONS, TELLING MPS THAT “PHONEY HUMANITARIANISM” WAS HOLDING BACK PLANS TO TACKLE CHANNEL CROSSINGS. But Labour said the decision showed the Government’s efforts were “completely unravelling”. Sir Keir Starmer slammed the policy as a “headline-grabbing gimmick”, telling the PA news agency during a visit to North Yorkshire: “What the court’s judgment shows is they’ve spent that £140m of taxpayers’ money without even doing the basics to see whether the scheme was really fit for purpose.” SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ken Clark Writing in The Telegraph, Mr Clarke said while he has advocated the benefits that migrants bring to Britain, “doing nothing about illegal immigration is not an option”. He said: “Importantly, in all the debate about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, no one has advanced an alternative. “I have listened keenly for an idea of how else we might deal with the mounting problem of irregular migration, but answer has come there none.” The flagship legislation passed through the House of Commons but has met fierce opposition in the Lords.

The overwhelming majority are hard-working, honest and decent – and want to do the best by their clients. But a small number are none of these things. The lawyers who coached would-be illegal immigrants to concoct fictional back-stories to secure asylum claims are putting a dagger through the heart of our justice system. They shame the profession to which I have devoted much of my life. A fair, honest and impartial legal system is the basis of our democracy. These revelations will shake people's faith in it. While all of us find the actions of career criminals deplorable, it is more shocking to discover that those who we expect to uphold the law are instead helping to perpetrate a fraud upon us all. I am appalled that solicitors and so-called 'legal advisers' should have behaved in such a way. To make matters worse, the cynical practices uncovered by the Mail appear to be widespread. Up to 40 law firms suspected of coaching asylum claimants to present false stories of persecution and oppression are now under investigation. Jerry Hayes (pictured) is a criminal barrister and ex-Tory MP for Harlow, Essex The lawyers who coached would-be illegal immigrants to concoct fictional back-stories to secure asylum claims are putting a dagger through the heart of our justice system (Muhammad Azfar Ahmad pictured in his office) The sheer range of techniques employed to game the asylum system also beggars belief. Encouraging illegal immigrants to get married to a British resident may be an old ruse, but it's still as effective. Handing out anti-depressants to use as 'evidence' of trauma is less well-known, but equally vile. By misleading the court, as these advisers proposed doing, not only are they in breach of their professional duties, but many would be committing criminal offences: namely, perverting the course of public justice, which usually – and rightly – results in an immediate custodial sentence.

THEIR ACTIONS MAKE IT HARDER FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED TO HAVE THEIR CLAIMS FAIRLY HEARD. It is almost beyond my comprehension that advisers working for firms governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority could instruct applicants on how to make up stories. For the firms that employ these advisors, ignorance should be no defence. The senior solicitors might not themselves have urged claimants to lie, but it is their responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen. There should have been safeguards, such as regular audits, to make sure employees were behaving ethically and lawfully. Their failure should carry severe consequences. One of the great popular myths about the legal profession is the idea that we lawyers treat the truth as something flexible. The question I'm always asked in a black cab is: 'How can you defend a murderer when you know he's guilty?' And the answer is: 'I can't defend him if he tells me he did it. Legally and ethically, it's forbidden.' Every law student learns legal ethics at the very start of their training. It's impossible to gain any qualifications without understanding them. In fact, one of my favourite dictums – and one that I pass on to young people coming into the profession – is: 'Never do anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the Daily Mail.' That's a great rule of thumb to help concentrate the mind on where the grey areas of ethics start. But the alleged behaviour of these lawyers in flouting immigration rules is not in any grey area. If true, it's as bad as any criminal I've prosecuted. If these allegations are proven, these men must be struck off, imprisoned and disgraced.

Rishi Sunak led criticism of rogue solicitors and legal advisers after our undercover investigation. The Prime Minister retweeted a link to the Mail’s investigation, saying: ‘This is what we’re up against. 'The Labour Party, a subset of lawyers, criminal gangs – they’re all on the same side, propping up a system of exploitation that profits from getting people to the UK illegally.’ Writing in the Mail today, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the probe was ‘hugely important’ and warned some of the practices were ‘potentially criminal’. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Immigration minister Robert Jenrick tweeted: ‘These individuals have no place in the legal profession. Swift action must be taken to remove from the roll all those who so egregiously abuse our laws.’ Questions surround what law could be used to prosecute solicitors and legal advisers who concoct fake stories for asylum seekers or who submit knowingly false claims. Immigrants who submit false asylum claims can face two years in jail, but there is no specific law covering the solicitors who cash in by helping them. LABOUR’S SHADOW ATTORNEY GENERAL EMILY THORNBERRY SAID: ‘WHAT HAS BEEN RECORDED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL, AND IT IS APPALLING TO THINK THAT THE SAME ADVICE MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN NUMEROUS REAL-LIFE CASES THAT WE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT. 'It is vital that we have a credible asylum process in our country, and it is disgusting to see any legal professional actively working to undermine it. ‘If there is evidence that they have facilitated fraudulent asylum claims in real-life cases, and made financial gains from doing so, then that should rightly be a matter for immediate investigation by the police.’ Alistair Carmichael, Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, added: ‘These reports are extremely concerning and need to be looked into. 'The Government’s approach is failing to tackle the trafficking gangs and all those who profit from this trade in human misery.’ Gareth Johnson, a Tory MP who also works as a solicitor, said: ‘This sort of despicable behaviour brings the whole profession into disrepute. 'If this goes unchecked if this goes it brings the whole profession down, so we need sanctions taken against these people.’ Legal authorities suggested those exposed by the Mail’s investigation could fall foul of section 25 of the 1971 Immigration Act, which prohibits facilitating illegal migration. 'But this is thought to apply only to those who help the act of unlawful entry, not helping the illegal immigrants after they have arrived. Alternatively, if they were knowingly helping people smuggler or crime gangs from the UK they could be in breach of this law. 'There is no suggestion the lawyers featured in the Mail’s investigation were doing do. There has been at least one conviction of a British-based lawyer under such law. On social media, senior lawyers discussing our story debated alternative grounds for a prosecution. 'Dinah Rose, a barrister and president of Magdalen College, Oxford, suggested that if lawyers encouraged clients to lie it could constitute ‘conspiracy to pervert the course of justice’ – a view supported by fellow barrister Adam Wagner. Among the rogue legal advisers we exposed was VP Lingajothy, who asked for £10,000 to invent a horrific back story to use in the asylum application, including claims of sexual torture, slave labour and imprisonment.

READ MORE: New Conservative MP in angry BBC clash on migrant cap bid [LATEST] Suella Braverman and Jeremy Hunt The Home Secretary yesterday told the Commons “immigration policy is under constant review”. Net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and those leaving - hit a record 606,000 last year. Tory MPs today (Monday) launched a report calling for more action to drastically reduce numbers. The New Conservatives said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour and argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. They set out a 12 point plan to cut numbers, including increasing the salary threshold for migrant workers and increasing the health surcharge. The Daily Express understands Home Office ministers have already floated both proposals but are frustrated at the resistance from the Treasury.

More info Visa and immigration applicants are currently charged £624 a year for using the health service. Raising that to £2,000 would be a “fairer” reflection of the costs, a source said. The minimum a skilled worker must earn to secure a visa in the UK is £26,200. But ministers believe that allows almost everyone who applies to qualify because it is set too low. The New Conservatives have called for it to be raised to £38,000. But the Treasury is said to fear that such measures will hit economic forecasts drawn up by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. Asked at the launch event for the migration report about tensions between the Home Office and the Treasury, Conservative MP James Daly said: “The Chancellor is a very reasonable man. “His stewardship of the economy is clearly taking us in the right direction. He is also a realistic man and he wants to respond to the needs of constituents around the country. There is always a balance to be had between what the Treasury desires and what other departments desire. But this is to such an extent now that I’m sure the Chancellor takes a very positive view of what we are saying.” Trending Ms Braverman was asked in the Commons about the possibility of raising the skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 a year. She said “net migration is too high” and that overall numbers needed to be reduced. We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review,” Ms Braverman added. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said the debate was “not just about GDP” but also includes “rapid social cultural change”, which needs to be “taken in the round”. He dismissed suggestions that universities will go bust as a result of the group’s recommendations that the rules around student visas are tightened up. “It’s not the job of government to prop up private institutions,” he said. Sunak launches new Illegal Migration Bill Mr Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. He called for the Government to go “further” but denied suggestions that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. The group pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration. Mr Hunt said the Prime Minister had been “incredibly brave” with his tough new Illegal Migration Bill that will allow migrants arriving illegally to be swiftly deported. He added: “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said that “huge volume” of migration to towns and cities in the last decade “changes the culture very significantly”. “It’s very difficult for local cultures, local communities, local societies to keep up with that change. It’s the pace of change that people find difficult as well as the change itself.” Ms Cates said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” A Treasury source said it was “not aware” of any issue relating to migration reforms that the Treasury or Chancellor is “blocking.” Who are the new conservatives? The New Conservatives launched in May with a mission to help the party reflect the interests of red wall voters that backed the party for the first time. As well as migration, the group wants to focus on cuts to the army, the rise of the “woke” agenda and tax freezes that have left people worse off. Made up of around 25 MPs from the last two general election intakes, members say their philosophy can be summed up in the phrase “common sense for the common good”. It adds: “We share the patriotic, kind, no-nonsense values of the British people, and for policies that will make us a stronger, safer and more united country.” Devizes MP Danny Kruger and Miriam Cates, who represents Penistone and Stocksbridge, founded the group. MPs on the right of the party from across the north and Midlands have signed up, including Stoke-on-Trent North’s Jonathan Gullis, James Daly, who represents Bury North, the most marginal constituency in the country, and Peterborough’s Paul Bristow, a close ally of Boris Johnson. Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson was expected to speak at yesterday's (MON) migration event but journalists were told he had “a terrible sick bug” and was at home recovering. MPs on the group have faced accusations they are undermining Rishi Sunak by setting out their own policy manifesto. But they all insisted they were loyal to the Prime Minister and were simply sharing ideas about how to resolve the seemingly impossible problem of rising migration.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1787186/suella-braverman-jeremy-hunt-migrants-tory-split-uk-economy,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1787186/suella-braverman-jeremy-hunt-migrants-tory-split-uk-economy

After a tense confrontation with 40 asylum seekers who took to the streets of central London in protest, the government has decided to implement the policy across the UK.

He said a lot of progress has been made on illegal migration in a short period of time with ""really unique landmark deals"" with France seeing a ""big increase"" in the number of interceptions on the beaches. But he said the asylum system - which according to Mr Jenrick has a backlog of more than 150,000 cases - must be changed ""fundamentally"". Migrants protested in London over hotel conditions He told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: ""The asylum system is riddled with abuse, we have to be honest with ourselves. ""The way to tackle that is by changing fundamentally the way we handle asylum."" Mr Jenrick said the Illegal Migration Bill to detain migrants who arrive through unauthorised means before returning them home or to a third country, such as Rwanda, will alleviate the pressure.

The shadow immigration minister, Stephen Kinnock, said the idea makes him “deeply unhappy” as it is the last thing the party wants to do. But he said Labour would have “no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit”. Kinnock told Sky News on Sunday: “Over the last 13 years, the Tory government has destroyed our asylum system. We’ll inherit a mess if we are privileged to win the next election.” When pressed if that meant Labour would continue to use the barges to house asylum seekers, Kinnock said: “The reality is, on day one we will have to deal with the we have and the shambolic mess they have left us. We’ll be left with no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit.” He told BBC Breakfast that he was confident a Labour government could get on top of the backlog within six months. The shadow minister refused to give a timeline on when a Labour government would stop using the barges and bring down the backlog from a record high of more than 172,000 cases. Kinnock’s comments came as the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said checks were still taking place on a controversial barge designed to house asylum seekers, with the first group due to be housed there within “weeks”. He said was confident the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, would become operational soon and that the government was taking into account concerns over fire safety. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph Dowden criticised those who have expressed concern over the asylum seeker barge, urging them to stop their “howls of outrage”.

It doesn’t mean they’ve been processed, it just puts people into limbo. Then essentially people are just slipping into the underground economy,” Kinnock said.

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “WE’VE WRITTEN TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SO FAR DECLINED TO TRAVEL, AND AS I UNDERSTAND A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THEM HAVE ALREADY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND AGREED TO MOVE,” THE MINISTER SAID. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm. But Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the barge as “a sign of failure” by the Government, noting that 10,000 more asylum claimants have been moved into hotels since Rishi Sunak vowed to “stop the boats” coming across the Channel as one of five pledges the Prime Minister made in January. The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said. Labour would end the use of hotels and barges, “going back to the low-cost, long-standing asylum accommodation of which we have tens of thousands of places in this country”. But pressed on Labour’s asylum policy answer if the party is returned to power, Ms Cooper said: “We don’t know what the scale of the chaos is going to be.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230811083055/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html

She has worked as a journalist.'}]","Yesterday's revelations — unearthed by the Mail's brilliant investigative team — that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading. One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair? READ MORE: The cynical story spun by a legal advisor to undercover reporters posing as an economic migrant who arrived on a small boat to help them beat the system Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/debate/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_2 - -> The answer is simple. The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

BUT IF YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIAN WITH ALL THE BACKBONE OF A JELLYFISH (STARMER), THEN THE ANSWER IS YES. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable. And why it's so damaging when, as in the case of these lawyers, they don't.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Britain launched trade talks with India in January last year, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has stressed that he won't sacrifice quality for speed in negotiations. Last year interior minister Suella Braverman sparked a row with comments about the possible impact of Indian migrants in trade talks, citing concern both with any ""open borders migration policy with India"" and those who overstay visas. Badenoch set out Britain's stance in response to a question about how government ensures it ""speaks with a single voice on migration and mobility in relation to a UK-India trade agreement,"" and avoids ""disruptive political off-stage noises."" ""An FTA with India will not contain commitments on immigration or provide access to the UK domestic labour market,"" Badenoch said in a written response to lawmakers published on Thursday. ""THERE WILL ALSO BE NO AGREEMENT TO ANYTHING WHICH UNDERMINES THE PRINCIPLES OR FUNCTIONING OF THE UK'S POINTS-BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, OR WHICH UNDERMINES THE UK'S ABILITY TO CONTROL ITS OWN BORDER."" She added that the negotiations would discuss business mobility, ""which would make it easier for highly skilled professionals to deliver services in each other's markets on a short-term and temporary basis."" Negotiators were also exploring provisions to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications where it might be possible with regulators, she said. Badenoch has previously warned that the deal may not have everything that the services sector would want. She did not make reference to when negotiations, which have not made quick progress this year, would conclude by, saying she would update lawmakers ""in due course"" on the talks.

The rule of law depends upon lawyers representing their clients robustly and to the best of their ability. Lawyers are entitled – indeed obliged – to find any credible legal angle that gets the best result for their client. But they are not allowed to lie. Nor are they allowed to encourage others to lie. That's why this hugely important investigation by the Mail is extremely shocking. The alleged behaviour this paper's reporters have uncovered is not only appalling and irresponsible, but potentially criminal. It shows why it has been so hard for the Government to remove people with no right to be here – and why we were right to change the law to curb spurious challenges to removal. We know that the majority of lawyers are professional practitioners, but we also know there are some lawyers who are ideologically opposed to illegal-migration controls. They have said so, proudly. 'I spent several years as a barrister defending the Home Office, often against spurious claims from migrants,' writes Home Secretary Suella Braverman (pictured) Sir Keir Starmer (pictured) has even argued that there is a 'racist undercurrent' which 'permeates all immigration law' They've gone to town in using domestic law, international law and other conventions to prevent the removal of small-boat entrants and even foreigners convicted of heinous crimes including murder and rape. And they've been cheered on by the Government's political opponents. Indeed, Sir Keir Starmer has even argued that there is a 'racist undercurrent' which 'permeates all immigration law'. To howls of protest, we have changed the law – through the Nationality and Borders Act and the new Illegal Migration Act – to close loopholes, stop people exploiting modern slavery laws, make it easier to remove foreign criminals and deprive those who come here illegally of any right to stay. And the Labour Party has tried to block us at every turn. The British people want us to stop the boats and remove foreign criminals. They're right and should feel no shame. Time and again the public have proven how generous they are to Syrians, Afghans, Hong Kongers, Ukrainians and others who need refuge. However, our local communities are being overwhelmed by migrants who paid people-smuggling gangsters to bring them here from safe countries such as France. Some 45,000 people arrived by small boats in the last year. The majority were adult males under the age of 40 and we are now spending more than £6million a day on hotels alone to house migrants in this country. Illegal migration makes us less safe, is unfair on taxpayers, supports organised crime, has led to thousands of people perishing needlessly at sea and disadvantaged the genuinely vulnerable who play by the rules. Nobody sane wants foreign rapists, paedophiles or murderers on our streets. Staff at solicitors’ firms readily agreed to help an undercover Mail reporter posing as an economic migrant get refugee status - despite being told he had no legitimate reason to stay in the UK after arriving on a small boat. VP Lingajothy (pictured) asked for £10,000 to invent a horrific back story to use in the asylum application Yet so-called progressives on the Left have utter contempt for public opinion and instead want to open our borders to any and everyone. I am shocked by what the Mail's brilliant journalists have uncovered, but I can't say I'm wholly surprised. I fear it may well be the tip of the iceberg. A good, honourable lawyer makes the most of the law. A dodgy lawyer will cheat and lie. THAT'S WHY I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO WORK WITH OUR AUTHORITIES TO TRACK DOWN AND PUNISH ANY LAWYERS OR FIRMS FOUND TO BE ENGAGING IN THESE KINDS OF PRACTICES. Either way, the law had to change. It contained too many loopholes for people to block or frustrate their removal. Now we have evidence that some lawyers would stop at nothing, including lying. I've been called a lot of ridiculous names for my tough stance. Well, every opponent of immigration controls should be eating their words today. I am very grateful to the Mail for showing why the Government, and the vast majority of the public, are on the right side when pushing for tougher action to stop the boats.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12337169/SUELLA-BRAVERMAN-trying-crack-people-smugglers-illegal-migrants-Labour-blocks-turn.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12337169/SUELLA-BRAVERMAN-trying-crack-people-smugglers-illegal-migrants-Labour-blocks-turn.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

September 26: The Home Office announces plans to acquire two jet skis to try to stop the migrant boats after a new record 416 migrants make the crossing in one day. October 27: A family of five, including three young children, drown after their boat capsizes in the Channel. November 28: Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin announce a new joint operational plan with more French police patrols and the deployment of cutting-edge surveillance and detection technology. December 31: At least 8,417 people arrived in small boats in the course of 2020, quadruple the number of the previous year. – 2021 March 24: Ms Patel says she will “consider all options” to offshore processing of asylum claims to third countries as she sets out plans to overhaul the immigration system. November 11: 1,185 migrants take advantage of the unseasonably mild weather to make the Channel crossing – a new record for a single day. November 15: Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin issue a joint statement vowing to prevent “100% of crossings”, making the Channel route “unviable” for migrants. November 24: 27 people, including a pregnant woman and three children, are drowned after their dinghy capsizes in the deadliest incident in the Channel since Mr Javid first declared a major emergency. Ms Patel is disinvited from a meeting of European interior ministers following a diplomatic row between Mr Johnson and President Emmanuel Macron over the response to the tragedy. December 31: The total number of arrivals for the year is 28,526. – 2022 April 14: Mr Johnson announces plan to deport migrants arriving in small boats to Rwanda for their claims to be processed, saying it would act as a “very considerable deterrent”.

August 23: The Ministry of Defence said 1,295 migrants made the crossing in 27 boats, another new record which remains the highest figure for a single day. August 25: Ms Patel announces an agreement with the Albanian government to curb the numbers of migrants from that country amid concerns they account for 60% of all those arriving in the UK. October 31: New Home Secretary Suella Braverman prompts uproar in the Commons when she describes the numbers of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the Channel as an “invasion on our southern coast”. November 14: Ms Braverman signs a new agreement with Mr Darmanin allowing British officers to join French beach patrols. November 23: Admitting the Government has “failed to control our borders”, Ms Braverman tells MPs they are determined to “fix” the problem, following criticism of overcrowding at the Manston processing centre in Kent. December 14: Four people die while 39 others are rescued after their dinghy capsized in the Channel. December 19: The High Court rules the Government’s Rwanda policy is legal but orders the cases of the first eight deportees to be reconsidered. CAMPAIGNERS LATER TAKE THE CASE TO THE COURT OF APPEAL. December 31: 45,755 migrants made the Channel crossing over the course of the year, according to Government figures. – 2023 January 4: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announces legislation to tackle the migrant crisis is one of five key priorities for his premiership. March 7: Ms Braverman tells MPs the Illegal Migration Bill will impose a legal duty to remove those arriving in the country illegally, barring them from claiming asylum in the UK. March 18: Visiting the country for the first time as Home Secretary, Ms Braverman doubles down on plans to send migrants to Rwanda despite the ongoing legal battle. March 29: The Government unveils plans to house asylum seekers on disused military bases, ferries and barges in a bid to cut spending on hotels. April 26: The Home Secretary says migrants crossing the Channel have values “at odds” with British norms and are linked to “heightened levels of criminality” – comments which are condemned by Labour. May 25: Figures show the asylum backlog has hit a new record high with more than three quarters of claims made by people who crossed the Channel since 2018 still awaiting a decision. June 5: Mr Sunak insists his plan to stop Channel crossings is “starting to work” but plays down suggestions that fewer arrivals were a result of poor weather conditions at the time of year rather than policy decisions. June 18: The number of Channel crossings for the year so far tops 10,000. June 26: Estimates in a Home Office assessment reveal £169,000 could be spent on every asylum seeker forcibly removed to a third country such as Rwanda. June 29: The Home Secretary lashes out at “phoney humanitarianism” hindering efforts to stop Channel crossings as the Government loses the latest legal battle over its plans to send migrants to Rwanda after a Court of Appeal ruling.

The Home Affairs Select Committee noted a spike in Albanian arrivals last year, but found little evidence to suggest its citizens were at risk. However, it said some Albanians making asylum claims, particularly women, had been trafficked and needed protection. The government said it was working with Albania to stop illegal migration. In a report published on Monday, the cross-party committee stressed that Albanian migrants to the UK were unlikely to require asylum. It highlighted figures showing that in 2022, more than a quarter of the 45,755 people who crossed the Channel in small boats came from Albania - ""and most claimed asylum"". It added the number of Albanians arriving in the UK by this route had gone from 800 in 2021, to 12,301 in 2022. ""Albania is a safe country,"" the MPs said. ""It is not at war and is a candidate country to join the European Union. ""There is no clear basis for the UK to routinely accept thousands of asylum applications from Albanian citizens, the committee finds."" It suggested that driving factors for people coming to the UK from Albania largely included better job opportunities and higher wages. Figures in the report also showed that from January to June 2022, 51% of Albanian cases were initially accepted - although the majority of these claimants arrived on ferries or planes rather than small boats. The committee said nine countries, including Germany, had accepted no asylum claims from Albania during that period. It called on the Home Office to explain why the UK's acceptance rate was so high - particularly compared to other countries. But the MPs also flagged there were ""unquestionably cases of Albanian citizens being trafficked to the UK"". It said more needed to be done to support the Albanian victims of people smuggling - especially women. Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, the committee's chairwoman, said there had been a ""substantial sudden increase in asylum claims from a seemingly peaceful country"". She said: ""While it is important that questions are asked and lessons are learnt, it is clear that the immigration picture is not static and will continue to evolve."" The MPs recommended the government promote seasonal work visas in agriculture and construction to give more Albanians the opportunity to come to the UK without making unauthorised Channel crossings. It also said appropriate safeguards must be put in place before any victims of trafficking were returned to Albania, and recommended the UK maintain strong links with the country's government. Dame Diana said: ""Changes in migration will inevitably place strain on any system, but the government must do much more to ensure it can better handle these stresses."" She also said it was important the ""UK improves its overall approach to asylum"". LAST WEEK IN KENT, PRIME MINISTER RISHI SUNAK SAID HIS PLAN TO TACKLE MIGRATION IS PROGRESSING , BUT THERE IS ""WORK TO DO"". He said a deal with Albania to return migrants had led to 1,800 people being sent back, and that was having a deterrent effect. A Home Office spokesperson said ""this government's priority is stopping the boats"". It went on: ""Last year, 28% of those who arrived by small boat to the UK were from Albania - a safe European country and Nato ally - placing further strain on our asylum system. ""We've worked closely with the Albanian government to disrupt criminal gangs and deter illegal migration. In the five months to the end of May, Albanian small boat arrivals are down 90% on last year and we have returned 1,800 illegal migrants and foreign criminals back to Albania. Thanks to changes to our asylum system, we have gone from accepting 1 in 5 Albanian asylum claims to just 1 in 50, in line with other European countries.

He has worked as a politician and has held the position of member of the 58th Parliament of the United Kingdom affiliated with the Conservative Party.'}]","A group of Tory MPs is calling on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to drastically cut migration, warning the failure to do so ""risks eroding public trust"". The New Conservatives have issued a 12-point plan to cut net migration by about 400,000 before the next election. The group of 25 MPs recommend closing visa schemes for care workers, increasing salary thresholds, and capping refugee numbers. But critics say the proposals would have consequences for the UK economy. The UK's overall population grew by more than 600,000 people last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said the rise was largely driven by more people from outside the EU arriving on student and work visas, and refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in Ukraine and Hong Kong. The sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since taking power in 2010. The party's 2019 manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000. In a report launched on Monday, the New Conservatives claim the British public ""did not vote for mass migration and the social and economic harms it brings"". ""Without swift action to get migration under control, the Conservative Party will further erode the trust of hundreds of thousands of voters who lent the party their vote in 2019,"" the report says. The report was written by Tory MP Tom Hunt and backed by a group of right-wing Conservatives, including the party's deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, and backbencher Miriam Cates. One of the report's main recommendations is closing temporary schemes that grant eligibility for worker visas to care workers. THE REPORT SAYS THIS POLICY WILL REDUCE VISAS GRANTED BY 117,000, LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN LONG-TERM INWARD MIGRATION TO THE UK OF 82,000. Part of this proposed policy involves only allowing in skilled workers who earn £38,000 a year or more. A report by the Skills for Care charity said the number of vacancies in social care was at its highest rate on record, with 165,000 unfilled posts in 2021-22. Ms Cates told the BBC the UK needed to cut off the supply of cheap foreign Labour and encourage from British people to fill jobs in the care sector. She said scrapping temporary visa schemes for care workers would force ""employers to look at recruiting local young people"". ""We are never ever going to make that possible unless we close the immigration route first,"" the Tory MP said. But fellow Tory MP Tim Loughton said while the principle of reducing met migration was right, there was a shortage of care workers in the UK. ""It's not as simple as just putting the salary thresholds up as well,"" he said. ""There's quite a lot of skilled but lower paid people that we need coming into this country."" Some of the report's other proposals include:
  Tightening restrictions on student visas to stop graduates staying in the UK for longer than two years without a job offer
  Capping the number of refugees legally accepted for resettlement in the UK at 20,000
  A 5% cap on the amount of social housing that councils can give to non-UK nationals
  Raising the health surcharge that an individual immigrant would pay to use the NHS to £2,700 per person, per year
  Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said ""trying to predict the impact of individual policy changes on migration is very hard"". ""Even the most fastidious attempts to model the impacts of policy on numbers - and this isn't one of them - will usually be wrong,"" she said. She said immigration policy was a ""political choice"" and there was ""no reason the UK couldn't choose to be more restrictive"". But she said the report does not ""engage with any of the trade-offs that more restrictive measures involve"". ""For example, one of the reasons demand for care workers has been so high is limited public funding in the care system,"" Ms Sumption said. ""International students have been a growing source of revenue for universities, so proposals that would reduce student numbers cannot be considered in isolation from the funding of higher education."" She said some of the proposals in the report were ""a bit outlandish"". ""Net migration is expected to decline anyway over the coming years even without policy changes,"" she added. ""However, if they want more significant restrictions it requires an honest conversation about the wider consequences and how to mitigate them."" Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migration

The overwhelming majority are hard-working, honest and decent – and want to do the best by their clients. But a small number are none of these things. THE LAWYERS WHO COACHED WOULD-BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO CONCOCT FICTIONAL BACK-STORIES TO SECURE ASYLUM CLAIMS ARE PUTTING A DAGGER THROUGH THE HEART OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. They shame the profession to which I have devoted much of my life. A fair, honest and impartial legal system is the basis of our democracy. These revelations will shake people's faith in it. While all of us find the actions of career criminals deplorable, it is more shocking to discover that those who we expect to uphold the law are instead helping to perpetrate a fraud upon us all. I am appalled that solicitors and so-called 'legal advisers' should have behaved in such a way. To make matters worse, the cynical practices uncovered by the Mail appear to be widespread. Up to 40 law firms suspected of coaching asylum claimants to present false stories of persecution and oppression are now under investigation. Jerry Hayes (pictured) is a criminal barrister and ex-Tory MP for Harlow, Essex The lawyers who coached would-be illegal immigrants to concoct fictional back-stories to secure asylum claims are putting a dagger through the heart of our justice system (Muhammad Azfar Ahmad pictured in his office) The sheer range of techniques employed to game the asylum system also beggars belief. Encouraging illegal immigrants to get married to a British resident may be an old ruse, but it's still as effective. Handing out anti-depressants to use as 'evidence' of trauma is less well-known, but equally vile. By misleading the court, as these advisers proposed doing, not only are they in breach of their professional duties, but many would be committing criminal offences: namely, perverting the course of public justice, which usually – and rightly – results in an immediate custodial sentence.

Their actions make it harder for those most in need to have their claims fairly heard. It is almost beyond my comprehension that advisers working for firms governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority could instruct applicants on how to make up stories. For the firms that employ these advisors, ignorance should be no defence. The senior solicitors might not themselves have urged claimants to lie, but it is their responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen. There should have been safeguards, such as regular audits, to make sure employees were behaving ethically and lawfully. Their failure should carry severe consequences. One of the great popular myths about the legal profession is the idea that we lawyers treat the truth as something flexible. The question I'm always asked in a black cab is: 'How can you defend a murderer when you know he's guilty?' And the answer is: 'I can't defend him if he tells me he did it. Legally and ethically, it's forbidden.' Every law student learns legal ethics at the very start of their training. It's impossible to gain any qualifications without understanding them. In fact, one of my favourite dictums – and one that I pass on to young people coming into the profession – is: 'Never do anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the Daily Mail.' That's a great rule of thumb to help concentrate the mind on where the grey areas of ethics start. But the alleged behaviour of these lawyers in flouting immigration rules is not in any grey area. If true, it's as bad as any criminal I've prosecuted. If these allegations are proven, these men must be struck off, imprisoned and disgraced.

The SNP leader revealed the fifth paper in a series outlining the Scottish Government's proposals for separation from the UK. The document, titled 'Citizenship in an independent Scotland', set outs Mr Yousaf's wish to sign up to full EU membership after breaking ties with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The 38-page paper suggests an independent Scotland would adopt a citizenship model similar to that of the Republic of Ireland. It states an independent Scotland would 'encourage people to live and work permanently in Scotland' such as through slashing citizenship fees for migrants. And, while the document also proposed new 'Scottish passports' for Scots after independence, it claimed there would no need for any passport checks when Scots cross the border with England or travel to Northern Ireland. Critics hit out at the Scottish Government's 'fantasy' plans for independence. Humza Yousaf unveiled plans to open up an independent Scotland to free movement for EU migrants The SNP leader revealed the fifth paper in a series outlining the Scottish Government's proposals for separation from the UK Mr Yousaf hailed his Scottish Government's plans as 'inclusive' and 'bold', claiming they would 'help boost both our population and economy' The 38-page paper suggests an independent Scotland would adopt a citizenship model similar to that of the Republic of Ireland The document proposed new 'Scottish passports' for Scots after independence, but claimed there would no need for any passport checks when Scots cross the border with England Mr Yousaf hailed his Scottish Government's plans as 'inclusive' and 'bold', claiming they would 'help boost both our population and economy'. 'Scotland's working population is being hit by a heartless Westminster migration system that isn't fit for purpose and a hard Brexit that Scotland didn't vote for, making our population challenges significantly worse,' the First Minister added. 'The Scottish Government wants to make it easier for people, including those seeking to reconnect with family roots, to gain citizenship and contribute to our economy, society and public services like the NHS. 'And when we re-join the EU as an independent country, Scottish citizens will be able to enjoy all the benefits of EU citizenship too.' The Scottish Government's latest independence paper claimed, even if an independent Scotland signed up to the EU, Scots would still maintain freedom of movement across the rest of the UK and Ireland due to membership of the Common Travel Area. It also stated Scotland would not have to fully become part of the EU's Schengen zone, which abolishes passport and other types of border controls between the bloc's member states. 'As a result of the CTA arrangements, there would be no new passport or immigration checks at any of an independent Scotland's land, sea or air border points with the UK and Ireland, and British, Irish and Scottish citizens would have the right to move freely within the CTA,' the paper said. 'Scottish citizens would also be able to take full advantage of their rights as EU citizens, just as citizens of Ireland do. 'The logic for there being special arrangements in EU law between Ireland and the UK would apply equally to an independent Scotland. 'The goal of the European project is to remove borders across the EU, not to introduce them where they do not currently exist.' The document said the Scottish Government's 'priority' in its migration policy was to 'encourage people to live and work permanently in Scotland'. 'We would want to remove disincentives to people choosing to settle here and make a commitment to our communities and economy,' the paper added, as it oulined plans to make citizenship fees cheaper than the current UK equivalent. The document set out four ways that people would become a Scottish citizen after independence. These are automatic entitlement on the day of independence; by birth after independence; by registering as a Scottish citizen; or by applying to become a Scottish citizen. Scottish citizenship would be open to those living in Scotland, those born in Scotland, those who have a parent who was a British citizen born in Scotland, or those who had previously lived in Scitland for at least ten years, or five years as a child. Donald Cameron, a Scottish Conservative MSP, accused the SNP of 'retreating to their independence comfort blanket' as they face a series of scandals. 'This latest self-indulgent paper touting independence is not just a blatant misuse of public money and resources by the SNP, it demonstrates how out of touch they are with the public,' he said. 'It's a sign of Humza Yousaf's weakness that he is once again obsessing on breaking up the UK – because it's the only issue his feuding party can agree on. 'Rather than wasting taxpayers' money and civil servants' time on pushing a divisive, party political agenda, a strong leader would be concentrating on the issues that matter to Scots – unacceptable NHS waiting times and the cost-of-living crisis. 'As for tackling population decline, the SNP's policy of making Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK is an active disincentive to people settling here.' Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said the paper was 'more therapy for Humza Yousaf and the nationalist movement than a serious attempt to persuade people to support their cause'. 'Even if it is just for a few hours, it must be a great relief to be distracted from broken ferries, ever longer waiting lists and a social care backlog that mushrooms,' he added. The anti-independence Scotland In Union campaign said: 'Taxpayers will find it galling that the SNP is forcing them to bankroll another fantasy document. 'There are so many other matters the Scottish Government should be focusing on.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12344143/SNPs-fantasy-plan-open-independent-Scotlands-borders-migrants-Humza-Yousaf-claims-WONT-need-passports-England.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12344143/SNPs-fantasy-plan-open-independent-Scotlands-borders-migrants-Humza-Yousaf-claims-WONT-need-passports-England.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

On social media and across Westminster, opinion appears to be somewhat split. While many have condemned the comments as vulgar and unbecoming of a person in public life – Dominic Grieve called them “foul” – plenty of others have welcomed the outburst as a politician speaking with refreshing candour. ANDERSON WAS SIMPLY “EXPRESSING THE DEEP FRUSTRATION OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC,” SAID IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK. Yet in Ashfield itself this weekend, there appeared to be a rather more uniform feeling about their MP’s latest moment in the national spotlight: embarrassment. “The man’s not fit to be in parliament,” said Hill, a retired lingerie factory owner, great grandfather-of-one and lifelong floating voter. “Coming out with that sort of language – it reflects badly on all of us here. It’s shameful. How can anyone hear that and then think he’s anything other than ignorant?” Anderson, it’s worth saying, should not be underestimated as a politician just because – as your nana might have said – he appears to need his mouth washing out with soap and water. Lee Anderson became an MP in 2019 (PA) A one-time Labour councillor, he became the first ever Tory MP to win this Red Wall seat – a former pit area where an Amazon warehouse is now the one of the biggest employers – at a general election. By tapping into both dissatisfaction that Brexit wasn’t getting done and general disillusionment about years of economic decline here, he managed to produce an astonishing 5,733 majority in his 2019 triumph. Ashfield itself could be the very definition of what commentators mean when they talk of the Red Wall. A former mining area, it had returned a Labour MP at every general election since its creation in 1955 before Anderson triumphed here in 2019. Its biggest town, Sutton-in-Ashfield – population 48,000 – is today dominated by a sprawling shopping centre where well-known value outlets – Bonmarche, Heron Frozen Foods, The Works – are neighboured by bargain stores, card shops, a Ladbrokes and a pawnbrokers. Outside, empty units are everywhere. Sutton-in-Ashfield is the biggest town in Ashfield and is dominated by a sprawling shopping centre (Alan Heardman/Geograph/CC BY-SA 2.0) His appeal, his supporters say, is in his willingness to say, unvarnished and unapologetically, what others are thinking. Long before his latest discharge, he had made headlines for claiming a healthy meal could be made for 30p; for calling for the death penalty to be reintroduced; and for refusing to watch England’s at Euro 2020 because the players took the knee in an anti-racism gesture. Yet, if such bon mots have made him a favourite of the Conservative grassroots, there is a sense they may just be wearing a touch thin here in Ashfield. “You only ever see him when he’s saying something stupid,” said Andy Birks, who runs Colledges Butchers in the Idlewells Shopping Centre in Sutton-in-Ashfield, the constituency’s biggest town. “There’s a lot of people round here who probably agree with [the sentiment of] what he said and have probably said the exact same thing themselves but that doesn’t mean you want your politicians talking like that. This is someone you’re supposed to be able to look up to.” Would he vote for him? “I’ll probably not vote for anyone but I will say this: if someone came in here and started using that language, they’d be told to leave. Or, If my son came out with it, he’d be getting a clip round the ear.” For Helen-Ann Smith, the comments were further proof that Anderson is all soundbite and no substance. As a councillor on Ashfield District Council and an assistant at a children’s play centre, the 35-year-old is constantly hearing people’s opinions. And on their MP? “I think people are asking what he’s done in four years,” she said. “And, other than make all these ridiculous comments, the answer is not much.” She herself is a member of the hyper local Ashfield Independents party, which currently runs the authority. “At the local elections, the Tories put Lee Anderson front and centre of all their literature,” she said. “And they’ve now lost all but two seats, which I think says a lot.” Her council colleague Matthew Relf agrees. Matthew Relf (Colin Drury) “There’s an awful lot of people who feel that politicians are always couching their language and don’t speak their mind enough,” he said. “And I think some people took to Lee because he was very different in that respect. But when you start effing and blinding about a serious matter like this – it loses people.” Some support remains for Anderson here, it should be said. A local business owner reckoned the MP was simply addressing an issue that many people were angry about. “Why can’t they [immigrants] stay on that barge anyway?” she asked. “They came here on dangerous small boats so what’s wrong with a safe big boat?” She asked not to be named – for fear her family might think she was defending fruity language. Tory councillor Dawn Justice also offered support for Anderson. She’d just got back from holiday – from France ironically – and hadn’t heard the outburst so, no, she wouldn’t be commenting on that. But, hang on, she would certainly say that he was very popular on the doorstep. “Whenever I have been canvassing with him, he always gets a positive response,” she said. “He connects with voters.” Not all of them, though. Back with John Hill, he pondered who he would vote for at the next election. “I normally make up my mind a few days before polling day,” he said. “But I can already tell you it won’t be him.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lee-anderson-outburst-ashfield-b2391594.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240519215603/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lee-anderson-outburst-ashfield-b2391594.html

To help accommodate arrivals, the Home Office bought the plush HD1 block in Huddersfield, West Yorks, which includes a gym, games room and cinema room.

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER {{ /VERIFYERRORS }} PRIME MINISTER RISHI SUNAK SAID THERE IS “LOTS OF WORK TO DO” TO REDUCE ASYLUM CLAIM NUMBERS AS HE JOINED IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ON A RAID. Mr Sunak wore heavy boots and a stab vest as he joined officers on the raid in Brent, north west London, early on Thursday morning. It comes after he promised to abolish the backlog of around 92,000 asylum claims by the end of 2023. However, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs on Wednesday that the target will not be met at the “current pace”. Asked after the raid about Ms Braverman’s comments, Mr Sunak said: “It was good to be out this morning with our immigration enforcement team and seeing first-hand their work to tackle illegal working. “That’s an important strand of our work, to stop the boats and tackle illegal migration. “And that’s because the criminal gangs use a business model that tempts people here with the offer of black market work. “It’s not right, which is why we’ve increased resources for immigration enforcement. “We’ve increased the number of raids like the one I was on this morning by 50% and we’ve doubled the number of arrests.” He added: “But we’re not complacent. “There’s lots of work to do, which is why it’s so important that we pass our Bill through Parliament, our Stop The Boats Bill, which will mean that if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay. “We will be able to detain you and then swiftly remove you.” Not long after Mr Sunak returned from the raid, Ms Braverman met French interior minister Gerald Darmanin in London.

The ruling comes just two days after the Home Secretary’s department moved asylum seekers on to Wethersfield Airfield for the first time. Braintree District Council and a nearby resident are bringing legal action to challenge the use of the Essex airfield to house up to 1,700 men while West Lindsey District Council is challenging similar plans for RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire. The development, which comes just two weeks after the Court of Appeal ruling on the Rwanda deal, may be seen by some as another setback in the Government’s plan to “stop the boats” and overhaul the asylum system. We are grateful to have had another opportunity to put our views and the views of our local community across to the High Court at this initial stage But the threshold for permission to bring forward a High Court challenge is low and an early stage in a judicial review claim. During a two-day hearing in London this week, the councils and Gabriel Clarke-Holland made a bid to bring a full legal challenge in their claims against the Home Office. In a ruling on Friday, Mrs Justice Thornton ruled in their favour, granting permission to both councils and Mr Clarke-Holland. She said: “The decision to accommodate asylum seekers on the sites may give rise to strong local opinion,” adding that there may also be wider discussions about the welfare of the asylum seekers. “Those are not, however, matters for the court,” the judge continued. The decision comes after the first 46 asylum seekers arrived at Wethersfield Airfield, around eight miles from Braintree, on Wednesday. Alex Goodman KC, for Mr Clarke-Holland – who lives approximately 80ft from a gate on to the airfield – said members of the right-wing group Britain First were protesting near his home on the morning of the arrivals. Following the ruling, Graham Butland, leader of Braintree District Council, said: “We are grateful to have had another opportunity to put our views and the views of our local community across to the High Court at this initial stage, as we still believe Wethersfield Airfield is not a suitable site for these plans.” He continued: “We’ll continue to work closely with the Home Office and multi-agency partners to ensure there is minimal impact on all those involved residents that live nearby and local services, as well as raising our concerns with the Home Office so it can put in place mitigating action, whilst supporting asylum seekers coming to our district. “We will also continue to push for regular, open and transparent engagement with the wider community, which to date we feel has been lacking and creating frustrations quite rightly for our residents and businesses who have been left with a void of information.” West Lindsey District Council leader Trevor Young said: “I welcome today’s judgment, which I hope the community will take as a positive in that it clearly shows we have a case. “However, as we have seen at other large sites across the country and in particular at Wethersfield, the Home Office is continuing to press ahead with its plans to use larger sites for asylum accommodation. “Therefore, our challenge is to continue to balance our legal process with our duty of care as a local authority, to hold the Home Office to account on their proposals, as we have been doing since March.” On Thursday the Government was given the go-ahead to take its legal battle over its Rwanda deportation policy to the Supreme Court. THE MOVE WAS WELCOMED BY MRS BRAVERMAN, WHO REITERATED HER BELIEF THAT THE PLAN IS “LAWFUL”. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had indicated he would seek an appeal as he “fundamentally” disagreed with the Court of Appeal’s ruling that the multimillion-pound deal – which would see asylum seekers deported to the East African nation – was unlawful.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/government-home-secretary-home-office-essex-high-court-b1094485.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/government-home-secretary-home-office-essex-high-court-b1094485.html

The regulator pledged to take 'urgent action' after our undercover expose found staff at some law firms were charging up to £10,000 to invent stories of torture, death threats and modern slavery designed to help clients apply for refugee status. Rishi Sunak and Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk said the allegations of 'appalling' conduct must be met with the 'full force of sanctions'. Politicians from across the political spectrum, including shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry and Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael have also called for the legal authorities to investigate. Posing as an economic migrant who had arrived in the UK illegally, our reporter found legal staff readily offering to help him submit false asylum claims, in apparent contravention of the solicitors' code of conduct. One legal adviser even offered to supply the reporter with antidepressants to show to the Home Office to support false claims that he was traumatised. Pictured: Muhammad Azfar from Kingswright Solicitors who suggested a marriage ploy to client Lawyer Vinnasythamby Lingajothy (pictured) offered to invent a horrific back story of torture, beatings, slave labour and death threats for an asylum application In a statement, the Solicitors Regulation Authority said: 'We can confirm we are investigating the firms/individuals. As a result of the information provided, we are looking to take urgent action to make sure the public are protected. At last, BBC reports our story The BBC finally reported the Mail's investigation into rogue immigration solicitors two days after it was first published. This newspaper's revelations on Tuesday prompted a furious response from the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and leading Labour politicians. But the BBC didn't report the findings until the early hours of yesterday morning in an online article, and a few hours later on Radio 4's Today Programme. In the article – which linked to our story in MailOnline – the broadcaster quoted the Justice Secretary Alex Chalk urging the Solicitors Regulation Authority to use the 'full force of sanctions' at its disposal. 'Solicitors are critical to the operation of a fair immigration system. I know that the overwhelming majority take their professional duties and obligations extremely seriously,' Mr Chalk KC wrote in a letter to the SRA. The article also quoted Mr Sunak, who praised the Mail's work in uncovering the 'truly shocking' behaviour. The PM said: 'It is vital that those found to be abusing their position face the full consequences of their actions.' Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> 'If we find evidence that solicitors or firms we regulate have acted in ways that contravene our rules, and in particular their duty to act legally and uphold the law, we can and will take action.' Mr Sunak said this week that the 'exploitation and unscrupulous practice' of rogue lawyers brought to light by the Mail were 'truly shocking'. IN A LETTER TO SRA CHAIRMAN ANNA BRADLEY, MR CHALK SAID 'ROBUST' ACTION WAS NEEDED TO RETAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. The SRA has the power to levy substantial fines and even shut down law firms with immediate effect. It can also refer rogue lawyers to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, which can levy unlimited fines and strike off solicitors, leaving them unable to practise. The Mail covertly visited a string of law firms with a reporter posing as an Indian national who had arrived in the UK illegally on a small boat to look for work. Muhammad Azfar Ahmad, a lawyer at Kingswright Solicitors in Birmingham, said getting married to a British citizen or someone with indefinite leave to remain would be a 'better thing' than pursuing a difficult-to-win asylum claim. Separately, Rashid Ahmad Khan, a lawyer with Rashid and Rashid Solicitors in Merton, south-west London, told our undercover reporter to write down the reasons why he was no longer safe in India just minutes after being told there were none, adding: 'You write one page I'll turn it into four pages.' Legal representative Vinnasythamby Lingajothy, representing Duncan Ellis Solicitors in south London, offered to invent a horrific back story of torture, beatings, slave labour and death threats for an asylum application – in return for a fee of £10,000. The law firm said it had sacked him. Convictions for people smuggling have fallen 36 per cent since 2010, according to research published by Labour.

Ministers reacted with fury to the Court of Appeal verdict in favour of several asylum seekers and a charity fighting against the Government policy. Campaigners called for the Government to drop its plans to send asylum applicants to Rwanda following the court ruling that the plan to deport migrants was unlawful amid concerns over the east African nation's asylum system. In a majority decision, judges overturned an earlier High Court ruling that said Rwanda could be considered a “safe third country”. The Government said it would seek to appeal against the ruling, with the Prime Minister saying he “fundamentally” disagreed with the decision.

The decision is the latest setback in Mr Sunak’s bid to “stop the boats” – one of his flagship pledges. Ms Braverman insisted that she still had “every confidence” in the plan while stressing that Rwanda was a safe country. Suella Braverman has vowed to continue with her asylum policy When asked if she blamed “lefty lawyers” or “the blob” amid the defeat, she told broadcasters: “The system is rigged against the British people, it’s as simple as that. “It’s why we’re changing the laws through our Illegal Migration Bill.” She then doubled down on her claims in the Commons, telling MPs that “phoney humanitarianism” was holding back plans to tackle Channel crossings. BUT LABOUR SAID THE DECISION SHOWED THE GOVERNMENT’S EFFORTS WERE “COMPLETELY UNRAVELLING”. Sir Keir Starmer slammed the policy as a “headline-grabbing gimmick”, telling the PA news agency during a visit to North Yorkshire: “What the court’s judgment shows is they’ve spent that £140m of taxpayers’ money without even doing the basics to see whether the scheme was really fit for purpose.” SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

December 31: Mr Javid bows to pressure from Tory MPs and announces two more Border Force cutters are to be stationed in the Channel, having previously warned they would act as a “magnet” for migrants. – 2019 January 24: Mr Javid and his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, announce a joint action plan aimed at halving the number of successful crossings over the summer and reducing it to an “infrequent phenomenon” by spring 2020. It includes more than £6 million for new security equipment such as CCTV and night goggles, increased beach patrols and intelligence sharing, and a commitment to conduct return operations as quickly as possible. August 9: A 31-year-old Iranian woman, Mitra Mehrad, becomes the first migrant known to have drowned while attempting the crossing after falling from a dinghy. August 23: Prime Minister Boris Johnson warns migrants “we will send you back” after almost 100 attempt the crossing in the space of 24 hours. December 31: 1,892 migrants are reported to have successfully crossed the Channel in the course of 2019, while 1,235 were intercepted by the French authorities. – 2020 July 12: Home Secretary Priti Patel and French interior minister Gerald Darmanin announce a new joint intelligence cell to counter the people smuggling gangs as 180 migrants make the crossing – the highest number to date on a single day. September 26: The Home Office announces plans to acquire two jet skis to try to stop the migrant boats after a new record 416 migrants make the crossing in one day. October 27: A family of five, including three young children, drown after their boat capsizes in the Channel. November 28: Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin announce a new joint operational plan with more French police patrols and the deployment of cutting-edge surveillance and detection technology. December 31: At least 8,417 people arrived in small boats in the course of 2020, quadruple the number of the previous year. – 2021 March 24: Ms Patel says she will “consider all options” to offshore processing of asylum claims to third countries as she sets out plans to overhaul the immigration system. November 11: 1,185 migrants take advantage of the unseasonably mild weather to make the Channel crossing – a new record for a single day. NOVEMBER 15: MS PATEL AND MR DARMANIN ISSUE A JOINT STATEMENT VOWING TO PREVENT “100% OF CROSSINGS”, MAKING THE CHANNEL ROUTE “UNVIABLE” FOR MIGRANTS. November 24: 27 people, including a pregnant woman and three children, are drowned after their dinghy capsizes in the deadliest incident in the Channel since Mr Javid first declared a major emergency. Ms Patel is disinvited from a meeting of European interior ministers following a diplomatic row between Mr Johnson and President Emmanuel Macron over the response to the tragedy. December 31: The total number of arrivals for the year is 28,526. – 2022 April 14: Mr Johnson announces plan to deport migrants arriving in small boats to Rwanda for their claims to be processed, saying it would act as a “very considerable deterrent”.

The fact-checking organisation Full Fact has obtained new freedom of information data which shows that between 1 January and 7 November 2022 only around 1% of all males arriving on small boats at Western Jet Foil claimed to be under 18 but were then later found to be over 18. Full Fact has written to Robert Jenrick asking him to correct the parliamentary record or to provide data which supports his claim. LAST NOVEMBER, JENRICK SAID IN PARLIAMENT: “AT TIMES, UP TO 20% OF THE ADULT MALES WHO ARRIVE AT WESTERN JET FOIL CLAIM TO BE UNDER 18, WHEN CLEARLY THE NUMBER IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT.” AN INITIAL REQUEST FULL FACT MADE TO JENRICK LAST NOVEMBER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE 20% CLAIM OR TO CORRECT THE PARLIAMENTARY RECORD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINISTERIAL CODE WENT UNANSWERED. The organisation then submitted a freedom of information request and received the data after several months of delay by the Home Office. It is not the first time Full Fact has raised concerns about the government’s use of immigration statistics. On 7 March 2023, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, accused Labour of leaving a far bigger asylum backlog than the government is currently dealing with. However, when Labour left power in 2010 the backlog was 18,954 and at the end of December 2022 it stood at 161,000. Full Fact raised concerns with the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) about ministers’ use of unpublished data and on 21 November the OSR’s director general, Ed Humpherson, wrote to Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary for the Home Office, to highlight the importance of transparency of statistics. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the job of the prime minister, the home secretary, and the minister for immigration to communicate accurately and responsibly with the public on important issues. “Repeated failure to be transparent makes proper democratic scrutiny impossible. It’s vital we’re all given access to the information behind the claims made by ministers when they make them, and that any data quoted publicly is freely available. Public trust in politics is low.

Everyone knows that it is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here. Ken Clark Writing in The Telegraph, Mr Clarke said while he has advocated the benefits that migrants bring to Britain, “doing nothing about illegal immigration is not an option”. He said: “Importantly, in all the debate about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, no one has advanced an alternative. “I have listened keenly for an idea of how else we might deal with the mounting problem of irregular migration, but answer has come there none.” The flagship legislation passed through the House of Commons but has met fierce opposition in the Lords. It aims to ensure those who arrive in the UK without permission will be detained and promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda. Mr Clarke said he is not making his comments out of “slavish loyalty” and he has not always been an admirer of the Government. BUT HE LAUDED THE GOVERNMENT’S APPROACH TO WELCOMING IN UKRAINIANS AND PEOPLE FROM HONG KONG. He said: “We are not becoming a walled-in, closed country. That is a good British contribution to a tremendous problem for the whole of the Western World. “Everyone knows that (illegal migration) is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here.” A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, from a Border Force vessel, following a small boat incident in the Channel in May (Gareth Fulle/ PA) It comes as 1,070 migrants crossed the Channel in 13 boats on Friday and in seven boats on Saturday, according to Home Office figures.

Rishi Sunak this week insisted that his pledge to 'stop the boats' was 'starting to work', as he revealed two more giant vessels will be used for migrant accommodation. The Prime Minister declined to say where the two new barges would be moored, but there is speculation that barges could be moored near Liverpool and Middlesbrough. The Guardian also reported the Royal Docks, which are managed by the Royal Docks Management Authority Limited, was among a number of other locations being discussed as part of plans to acquire more barges and former cruise ships. The Home Office on Thursday declined to confirm whether the London docks was part of discussions. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for the British taxpayer than expensive hotels. 'This is why we continue to source new alternative sites and vessels to accommodate migrants, which are more manageable for communities, as our European neighbours are doing. 'We understand the concerns of local communities and will work closely with councils and key partners to manage the impact of using these sites, including liaising with local police to make sure appropriate arrangements are in place.' The Government's Illegal Migration Bill is currently in the Lords, where it has faced strong criticism and close scrutiny from peers.

Hundreds were due to stay on Catterick Garrison, which is in Rishi Sunak’s constituency. The Home Office is attempting to make major savings on the £6million-a-day bill for putting up arrivals in hotels. One Army source claimed that garrison commander Lt Col Jim Turner had rejected Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s plan, saying it would threaten a regeneration scheme in the North Yorkshire military town. But a senior government source dismissed this view yesterday and told the Daily Express: “The Army is scared of asylum seekers. THEY CLAIM THEY ARE A THREAT.” IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK HAD REVEALED PLANS TO USE THE BASE TO HOST ASYLUM SEEKERS IN MARCH.

Around 51,000 migrants are in the taxpayer-funded accommodation. The Express understands officials want to use “empty” buildings at the base – the Army’s largest operational garrison – but are still trying to agree on plans that “ensure the uninterrupted delivery of military activity”. The base, some 20 miles south of Darlington, is home to 13,000 people and contains 19 barrack compounds. A defence source said: “Part of the land they were going to use [for redevelopment] was the land they were going to use for the asylum accommodation. “The garrison commander said they can’t have part of that land as it was going to be included in the first part of the investment scheme. They have reviewed it and they have come to a different decision. As we understand it, it is being reviewed.

My understanding is the Home Office said ‘We don’t care’, even though the Army said this was a bad idea. That is when politics came into it.” Another defence source dismissed suggestions of a row, but said that those involved are “working through what’s possible”. A government spokesman said last night: “Work is ongoing to bring forward accommodation at Catterick Garrison. “This work is part of our broader efforts to move to a more orderly, cost-effective and sustainable system for accommodating asylum seekers using alternative sites.” Ms Braverman unimpressed with setbacks against migrants plans Some 14,782 migrants have crossed the Channel this year but the next three months are expected to be the busiest, with trafficking gangs nearing peak activity in the better weather. A total of 45,755 crossed to Britain last year and the busiest months were August, September and October. Ms Braverman wants to house asylum seekers in former military bases, on barges and on disused cruise ships. The Home Office has also bought large tents for up to 2,000 migrants.

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" from crossing the English Channel as one of his five pledges after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of hundreds of migrants in hotels after record numbers arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. The opposition Labour Party said Sunak had failed to clear the backlog of tens of thousands of asylum claims and that 7,600 people had crossed the English Channel so far this year - a total that is likely to increase over the summer months. Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving and a toughening of the country's stance on immigration can produce results. HE SAID A DEAL WITH ALBANIA HAD MEANT THAT BRITAIN WAS RETURNING MORE MIGRANTS TO THE COUNTRY AND THAT LONDON WAS INCREASING ITS PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION FOR THOSE AWAITING IMMIGRATION DECISIONS. He said the government had secured two new vessels to house migrants to move them out of hotels. Sunak said so far this year, ""the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%"" and that Britain was now accepting one in 50 Albanian asylum cases compared with one in five previously. He urged parliament to pass his new Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for the swift detention and deportation of people arriving on small boats back to their homeland or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda. It is now in the upper house of parliament, where peers could try to weaken some its provisions. ""This won't be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it's so important that we change the law,"" he said. ""My policy is very simple: it is this country - and your government - who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. I will do what is necessary to achieve it. I said I would stop the boats and I meant it.""

The proposals are a crucial part of Rishi Sunak's vow to 'stop the boats'. Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that critics of the Bill had not put forward any 'credible alternative'. 'It's incumbent on those who choose to criticise our approach to provide an alternative. 'It's not a serious or grown-up way to conduct a debate to say, 'well we have concerns about Rwanda', 'we don't like the compliant environment' – 'We don't want this, we don't want to', but not to come up with an alternative.' At Business Questions, Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt confirmed time will be set aside to debate the Bill on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week before Parliament's summer recess begins on Thursday.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12298559/No-concessions-Channel-migrant-Bill-ministers-warn-peers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12298559/No-concessions-Channel-migrant-Bill-ministers-warn-peers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, said the centre risked becoming overcrowded “if sufficient onward accommodation is not available”. In a statement, Mr Neal said: “While plans for housing on barges and ex-military sites have been announced, the capacity of these facilities will be limited. Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated.” Find out below what the Manston immigration centre is and why it’s facing these issues. What is the centre? The Manston immigration centre opened in February 2022, to process migrants who arrived in the UK on small boats. The Home Office intended to hold the migrants at the centre for up to five days while they underwent security checks. The migrants would then be moved into accommodation, usually hotels. Migrants who did not pass security checks would be moved to immigration detention centres. Around 700 migrants were moved to the Manston centre following a petrol bomb attack on another such venue in Dover. Clandestine channel threat commander Dan O’Mahoney said opening the centre “was a recognition of the fact that the facilities that we had on the docks site down in Dover were not sufficient to deal with the volumes we thought we were going to experience this year”. He also said: “The aim was to run a site that had between 1,000 and 1,600 people passing through it every day, and that all of those checks would be completed in under 24 hours. For a large part of this year, that is exactly how it was operating, and you will have seen that.” Where is Manston migrant centre? The Manston immigration centre is on the former Defence Fire Training and Development Centre site, next to Manston International Airport. Manston is a village in Kent, south-east England. It is north-west of Ramsgate, south of Margate, and about 20 miles north of Dover. What are the problems with Manston? Conservative MP Roger Gale has said there were around 4,000 migrants at the centre, which he described as being “overwhelmed”. Some migrants are having to spend longer at the centre due to a lack of accommodation. Mr O’Mahoney said: “As the year went on, it became increasingly difficult to move people off the site, and we have had to increase the capacity of the site and then, necessarily, the length of time that people have been on the site, because we have not been able to move them out into asylum accommodation as quickly as we would have wanted to.” PA news agency analysis of government figures shows that 7,961 people arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in September. Last autumn, the UK Health Security Agency warned that accommodation settings should be considered “high-risk for infectious diseases”. The Home Office suspected that a man’s death at the centre in November could have been caused by a diptheria infection. A government watchdog has also warned the Home Office that the centre is failing to make sure vulnerable children are being identified and helped, and that there is a lack of adequate leadership. What did Home Secretary Suella Braverman say about migrants? The Home Secretary Suella Braverman has been criticised for the language she used to describe migrants. In the House of Commons on Monday, Ms Braverman said: “The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern coast and which party is not. “Let’s stop pretending they are all refugees in distress.” Her comments were criticised by Mr Jenrick, who told Sky News: “In a job like mine, you have to choose your words very carefully. “AND I WOULD NEVER DEMONISE PEOPLE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY IN PURSUIT OF A BETTER LIFE. I understand and appreciate our obligation to refugees.” Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""No home secretary who was serious about public safety or national security would use highly inflammatory language on the day after a dangerous petrol bomb attack on a Dover initial processing centre.""",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/manston-migrant-centre-where-what-problems-immigration-b1036706.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230616163632/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/manston-migrant-centre-where-what-problems-immigration-b1036706.html

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the Government must clamp down on attractive pull factors to prevent the UK being seen as a “soft touch”. People smugglers will often promise migrants jobs and housing if they pay them thousands of pounds to risk their lives and cross the English channel in flimsy dinghies. Mr Jenrick declared last night: “Making it harder for illegal migrants to work and operate in the UK is vital to deterring dangerous, unnecessary boat crossings. “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue. “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks, and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties.” Employers face fines of up to £45,000 for every illegal migrant they help - triple the previous amount of £15,000. Bosses who have been caught harbouring illegal migrants before could be hit with a £60,000 penalty for every worker who does not have the right to remain in the UK. Government officials say more must be done to prevent UK being seen as 'soft touch' The fines for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes will also rocket, the Home Office confirmed last night. Landlords will be fined £5,000 for every lodger and £10,000 for every occupier of a property. This will double for any repeat offenders. It was previously £80 per lodger and £1,000 for every occupier. The Home Office last night revealed 4,000 employers have been hit with civil penalties since 2018. But only 230 landlords have been fined for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes from them over the same five year period. Officials stated: “Increasing fines will deter employers and landlords from engaging in these illegal and dangerous practices, further deterring people from attempting to come to the UK illegally.” Migrants believe they will face harsher punishments in France than they will in UK, says Mr Jenrick Mr Jenrick told GB News: “We are [reducing the pull factors]. “That’s exactly the work I have been doing over the last six months with Suella Braverman. We have changed the accommodation people are staying in. “The Labour Party say they don’t like us using disused military sites and barges. My post bag from Labour MPs is claiming the accommodation is not luxurious enough. “I think we have to make sure the UK is not perceived to be a soft touch. “The overwhelming majority of the people coming in small boats are coming from France, from a safe country with a well functioning asylum system. “They are choosing to come to the UK and that must be in part because of the perception that the UK is a softer touch. “That is why we are changing accommodation. That is why we are making it harder to live and work illegally in the UK with a 50 per cent rise in the number of raids this year to try and close down bogus employers.” SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

More info Mrs Braverman refused to say whether the Government will stop the boats before the next election The Immigration minister also yesterday confirmed the Government will press ahead with plans to house asylum seekers on cruise ships. The first migrants are expected to arrive on the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge today after a series of delays. But Home Secretary Suella Braverman was dealt a blow as two ports refused permission for two cruise ships to berth and house asylum seekers. Mr Jenrick admitted: “We’re in conversation with a number of other ports and hoping that we can secure those very soon. “It's true that a couple of ports did back out, mostly because local Labour councils like in Birkenhead and in Leith in Edinburgh refused to support us, hypocritically actually if you look at the Leith example. “That's a Labour council that housed Ukrainian refugees on the same barge, same boat, but refused to house asylum seekers, all the time saying that they are a city of sanctuary.” Some 15,121 migrants have crossed the English Channel this year. But ministers and Border Force are braced for a surge in crossings as the weather improves this week. Trending Friday’s arrivals were the first since July 26 amid wind and rain in the Channel. Home Secretary Suella Braverman yesterday admitted that it is “going to be a tough Summer” as the weather improves. Mrs Braverman said: “I look closely at what the incoming flows are like, and we still have too many people coming across the Channel. We still need to honour our pledge to the British people to stop the boats.” But the Home Secretary refused to say whether the Government will stop the boats before the next election.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1799369/No10-to-punish-hiding-illegal-migrants,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1799369/No10-to-punish-hiding-illegal-migrants

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. RATIONAL, FACTUALLY GROUNDED FEARS SHOULDN’T BE DIRECTED AT MIGRANTS AND MINORITIES, BUT AT POLITICIANS WHO SEEK TO GAIN POWER BY BLAMING THEM FOR THE ILLS AND INJUSTICES THEY CAUSED. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration

However, more needs to be done to support the Albanian victims of people smuggling, especially women, the Home Affairs Select Committee said. In a report published on Monday focusing on Albania, the committee said there was no clear basis for the UK to accept thousands of asylum applications from Albanian citizens. It comes after migration data revealed more than a quarter of the 45,755 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2022 were Albanian, most of whom made an asylum claim. The number of Albanians making the channel crossing in small boats rose from 800 in 2021 to 12,301 last year. The UK should look at how access to work visa schemes can be improved to fill our skills or staffing gaps while offering Albanian nationals a route to higher income, benefiting both nations Labour chair of the committee Dame Diana Johnson MP said: “Such a substantial sudden increase in asylum claims from a seemingly peaceful country understandably raised concerns. “While it is important that questions are asked and lessons are learnt, it is clear that the immigration picture is not static and will continue to evolve. “New challenges are likely to continue to emerge and it is important that the UK improves its overall approach to asylum, rather than focus on one country.” The committee said the main driver of migration from Albania was economic and recommended the Government promote seasonal work visas in agriculture and construction to give more Albanians the opportunity to come to the UK without making unauthorised channel crossings. The committee also said that while claims for political asylum “should not normally be entertained”, there are “unquestionably cases of Albanian citizens being trafficked to the UK”. It said appropriate safeguards must be in place before any victims of trafficking are returned to Albania and also recommended the UK maintain strong links with the country’s government. Dame Diana added: “Changes in migration will inevitably place strain on any system, but the Government must do much more to ensure it can better handle these stresses. “MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST IMPROVE THE SPEED OF DECISION-MAKING AND CLEAR THE BACKLOG AS WE SET OUT IN OUR CHANNEL CROSSINGS REPORT IN 2022. We expect the Home Office to set out how it plans to achieve this. “People will continue to be attracted to the UK from Albania while it continues to offer job opportunities and higher wages. “The UK should look at how access to work visa schemes can be improved to fill our skills or staffing gaps while offering Albanian nationals a route to higher income, benefiting both nations.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/home-affairs-select-committee-albania-diana-johnson-mps-government-b1087061.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/home-affairs-select-committee-albania-diana-johnson-mps-government-b1087061.html

The Opposition accused Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman of overseeing “complete chaos” as Home Office data showed a record 175,000 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June. The figure is up 44% from a year earlier and the highest since current records began in 2010. The record high asylum backlog is having a devastating impact on the people we work with Enver Solomon, Refugee Council Campaigners blamed Government policy for leaving people “languishing in limbo and unsafe accommodation”, and warned it is “causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives”. The data, which also shows 80% of people have been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision on their claim, piles further pressure on Mr Sunak, who has made tackling small boat Channel crossings one of his top five priorities. STEPHEN KINNOCK, LABOUR’S SHADOW IMMIGRATION MINISTER, SAID: “THESE NEW STATISTICS SET OUT IN STARK TERMS THE COMPLETE CHAOS THE TORIES HAVE CREATED IN THE IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM SYSTEM. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day.” Ministers hope to accommodate migrants on the Bibby Stockholm barge despite a series of setbacks (John Gurd/PA) Ministers are looking to house migrants on former military bases and a barge to reduce the expense of accommodating them in hotels. Freedom from Torture’s associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “This is a crisis of the Government’s own making. The huge backlog of asylum claims is the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect that has left over 175,000 people – over a third more than last year – languishing in limbo and unsafe accommodation. “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” She also noted that Home Office statistics showing that just over seven in 10 of initial decisions in the year to June were grants of refugee status “disprove the Government’s toxic narrative” as they left “no doubt that most people reaching our shores are refugees – men, women, and children fleeing the most unimaginable horrors”. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said: “The record high asylum backlog is having a devastating impact on the people we work with, whose lives are put on hold indefinitely while they anxiously wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay in the UK.” The Home Office's approach to the asylum backlog could push people underground.

The Institute for Public Policy Research also called the alarm bells over withdrawals, which made up 47% of all initial asylum decisions. Marley Morris, associate director for migration, trade and communities, said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the Government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” The British Red Cross also said the Government must “urgently review its efforts to reduce the backlog and publish data on why vulnerable people’s claims are being withdrawn”. It is “deeply concerned” about the “toll” being stuck in the asylum backlog “for months or even years” takes on people’s physical and mental health. (PA Graphics) Rachel Goodall, head of asylum services at Refugee Action, said: “The huge backlog in asylum decision making is a product of the Government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives. “It has forced thousands of people into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and MoD (Ministry of Defence) sites from which only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit.” The charity called for the Government to give asylum seekers leave to remain in the UK if they end up waiting more than a year for a decision on a claim. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: “It’s time for the Home Secretary to stop grandstanding and finally get serious. “That means tackling these failures and creating an immigration system that works for the UK and our economy, while treating everyone with dignity and respect.” Downing Street and the Home Office have been contacted for comment.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-12441095/Soaring-asylum-backlog-deemed-disastrous-record-Sunak-Braverman.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-12441095/Soaring-asylum-backlog-deemed-disastrous-record-Sunak-Braverman.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. BUT MR JENRICK SAID THE GOVERNMENT, WHILE LEGALLY BOUND TO PROVIDE BASIC ACCOMMODATION, WAS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO OFFER THEM AN “À LA CARTE MENU” OF OPTIONS AS IT BATTLES TO CUT DOWN A DAILY BILL OF £6M ON ASYLUM HOTELS. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm. But Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the barge as “a sign of failure” by the Government, noting that 10,000 more asylum claimants have been moved into hotels since Rishi Sunak vowed to “stop the boats” coming across the Channel as one of five pledges the Prime Minister made in January. The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said. Labour would end the use of hotels and barges, “going back to the low-cost, long-standing asylum accommodation of which we have tens of thousands of places in this country”. But pressed on Labour’s asylum policy answer if the party is returned to power, Ms Cooper said: “We don’t know what the scale of the chaos is going to be.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230811083055/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html

He has worked as a journalist, blogger, opinion journalist and has held the position of Booker Prize judge.'}]","Universities are becoming primary victims of the chaos enveloping Britain’s public sector. News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. SOME UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING MANCHESTER, GLASGOW, SHEFFIELD, UCL AND IMPERIAL, RELY ON CHINESE STUDENTS ALONE FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. YUI MOK/POOL VIA REUTERS        LONDON, JUNE 5 (REUTERS) - BRITISH PRIME MINISTER RISHI SUNAK SAID ON MONDAY HIS PLAN TO STOP MIGRANTS ARRIVING IN SMALL BOATS HAD REDUCED CROSSINGS BY 20%, AN UPDATE HE HOPES WILL EASE CRITICISM FROM HIS PARTY AND IN THE COUNTRY OVER IMMIGRATION POLICY. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" from crossing the English Channel as one of his five pledges after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of hundreds of migrants in hotels after record numbers arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. The opposition Labour Party said Sunak had failed to clear the backlog of tens of thousands of asylum claims and that 7,600 people had crossed the English Channel so far this year - a total that is likely to increase over the summer months. Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving and a toughening of the country's stance on immigration can produce results. He said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country and that London was increasing its provision of accommodation for those awaiting immigration decisions. He said the government had secured two new vessels to house migrants to move them out of hotels. Sunak said so far this year, ""the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%"" and that Britain was now accepting one in 50 Albanian asylum cases compared with one in five previously. He urged parliament to pass his new Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for the swift detention and deportation of people arriving on small boats back to their homeland or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda. It is now in the upper house of parliament, where peers could try to weaken some its provisions. ""This won't be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it's so important that we change the law,"" he said. ""My policy is very simple: it is this country - and your government - who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. I will do what is necessary to achieve it. I said I would stop the boats and I meant it.""

The New Conservatives group of backbenchers wants to reduce the number of study visas by around 75,000 by excluding the worst universities from eligibility. 1 Tory MPs say slashing immigration must not be compromised to prop up universities Credit: Alamy It is among 12 demands they are making to Rishi Sunak in a new report which they believe will reduce net migration by 400,000. Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. THEY WANT TO END THE “ADDICTION” TO CHEAP FOREIGN LABOUR AND GET THE 5MILLION BRITS ON OUT OF WORK BENEFITS FILLING VACANCIES. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”. Yesterday the 25-strong New Conservatives insisted they were not “rebels” and fully supported the PM. Tory Party deputy Lee Anderson fuelled speculation he had been reined in by No10 after pulling out of the event at the last minute - but later claimed to be sick. But the caucus warned Mr Sunak would lose the next election if he “kicked the can” of immigration down the road. Red Wall MP Miriam Cates said failing to keep numbers down “raises deep concerns about national and cultural security”. She said: “Particularly in towns and cities, a huge volume of immigration over over the last 10 years particularly, those of course, change the culture in society very significantly.” Hitting back at critics, Mr Hunt said it was “disparaging to label people xenophobes” for voicing fears about migration. Bury MP James Daly said immigration is the biggest issue to his voters “by a million miles”. And Danny Kruger said his cabal were rallying against the “establishment” on migration reforms. The PM’s spokesman said: “We have to strike the right balance between tackling net migration and ensuring we have the right style to match the needs of the public.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/,http://web.archive.org/web/20230711205606/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/

A Home Office spokesman said the unit had already uncovered links between an immigration advice firm and 'one of the most wanted human traffickers'.

Evidence dossiers will be passed on to police or the National Crime Agency to launch prosecutions. In addition, there will be improved intelligence-sharing across a range of departments and quangos. Mrs Braverman will today chair a meeting with her Cabinet colleague Alex Chalk, the Solicitors Regulation Authority watchdog and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner to herald the new crackdown.

'This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.' The Mail's investigation led to the SRA suspending three legal firms caught offering to lodge fake asylum applications. The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Two said they would falsely claim that the undercover reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers.

The rule of law depends upon lawyers representing their clients robustly and to the best of their ability. Lawyers are entitled – indeed obliged – to find any credible legal angle that gets the best result for their client. But they are not allowed to lie. Nor are they allowed to encourage others to lie. That's why this hugely important investigation by the Mail is extremely shocking. The alleged behaviour this paper's reporters have uncovered is not only appalling and irresponsible, but potentially criminal. It shows why it has been so hard for the Government to remove people with no right to be here – and why we were right to change the law to curb spurious challenges to removal. We know that the majority of lawyers are professional practitioners, but we also know there are some lawyers who are ideologically opposed to illegal-migration controls. They have said so, proudly. 'I spent several years as a barrister defending the Home Office, often against spurious claims from migrants,' writes Home Secretary Suella Braverman (pictured) Sir Keir Starmer (pictured) has even argued that there is a 'racist undercurrent' which 'permeates all immigration law' They've gone to town in using domestic law, international law and other conventions to prevent the removal of small-boat entrants and even foreigners convicted of heinous crimes including murder and rape. And they've been cheered on by the Government's political opponents. Indeed, Sir Keir Starmer has even argued that there is a 'racist undercurrent' which 'permeates all immigration law'. To howls of protest, we have changed the law – through the Nationality and Borders Act and the new Illegal Migration Act – to close loopholes, stop people exploiting modern slavery laws, make it easier to remove foreign criminals and deprive those who come here illegally of any right to stay. And the Labour Party has tried to block us at every turn. The British people want us to stop the boats and remove foreign criminals. They're right and should feel no shame. Time and again the public have proven how generous they are to Syrians, Afghans, Hong Kongers, Ukrainians and others who need refuge. However, our local communities are being overwhelmed by migrants who paid people-smuggling gangsters to bring them here from safe countries such as France. Some 45,000 people arrived by small boats in the last year. The majority were adult males under the age of 40 and we are now spending more than £6million a day on hotels alone to house migrants in this country. Illegal migration makes us less safe, is unfair on taxpayers, supports organised crime, has led to thousands of people perishing needlessly at sea and disadvantaged the genuinely vulnerable who play by the rules. Nobody sane wants foreign rapists, paedophiles or murderers on our streets. Staff at solicitors’ firms readily agreed to help an undercover Mail reporter posing as an economic migrant get refugee status - despite being told he had no legitimate reason to stay in the UK after arriving on a small boat. VP Lingajothy (pictured) asked for £10,000 to invent a horrific back story to use in the asylum application Yet so-called progressives on the Left have utter contempt for public opinion and instead want to open our borders to any and everyone. I am shocked by what the Mail's brilliant journalists have uncovered, but I can't say I'm wholly surprised. I fear it may well be the tip of the iceberg. A good, honourable lawyer makes the most of the law. A dodgy lawyer will cheat and lie. That's why I am doing everything I can to work with our authorities to track down and punish any lawyers or firms found to be engaging in these kinds of practices. Either way, the law had to change. It contained too many loopholes for people to block or frustrate their removal. Now we have evidence that some lawyers would stop at nothing, including lying. I've been called a lot of ridiculous names for my tough stance. Well, every opponent of immigration controls should be eating their words today.

Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving can produce results. He said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country and that London was increasing its provision of accommodation for those awaiting immigration decisions. Sunak said so far this year ""the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%"" and that Britain was now accepting one in 50 Albanian asylum cases compared with one in five previously. More than 5,000 asylum seekers in total would be moved out of hotels - which currently cost 6 million pounds ($7.4 million) per day - into two new sites and two new vessels, the interior ministry said. Sunak urged parliament to pass his new Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for the swift detention and deportation of people arriving on small boats back to their homeland or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda.

Damning stats out today showed staggering numbers of people came to Britain in the last year - but few criminals were booted out. 4 A boat carrying 50 migrants drifted into English waters earlier today Credit: Getty Just 4,193 wrong-uns were sent back home - an increase on the year before but still thousands fewer than before the pandemic. Most of them (72 per cent) were foreign national offenders who had committed horrific crimes. The asylum backlog in the UK has now hit a record high too - giving the PM a fresh headache as he battles to stop the boats and push down the number of legacy cases. It came as another 345 migrants made their way to the UK yesterday - making the last fortnight the worst this year. The huge data dump from the Home Office also revealed: A whopping 78,000 asylum applications were made in the last year - the highest number in TWO decades Half a million people were offered a visa after fleeing from Ukraine, Hong Kong, or were resettling with family 125million people arrived in the UK to visit, live or work last year - almost twice as many as the year before where travel had been hit by Covid 3.2million visas were granted last year - 58 per cent higher than the year before A staggering 900,000 of those were visitor visas - with work visas up by two thirds to 530,000 and study visas up a third to 650,000 Family visas also doubled to 75,000 as yet more partners came to join their other halves in the UK The cost of the UK's asylum system has almost doubled in just a year - as so many more people have come here The staggering numbers come despite the Government repeatedly promising to lower the number of people coming to the UK. Rishi Sunak has repeatedly refused to commit to slashing net migration to the tens of thousands (under 100,000) - a promise made in the Tory manifesto. BUT NOW HE IS ONLY PROMISING TO CUT IT TO BELOW THE NUMBER HE INHERITED WHEN HE GOT INTO NO10 LAST NOVEMBER. Critics say that increasing numbers of people coming to the UK is only piling more pressure in Britain's housing system, NHS and other services. Alp Mehmet, Chairman of Migration Watch UK hit out at the latest stark stats, saying: ""These are damning figures and a stark reminder of the scale of the government’s failure to control, let alone reduce, immigration.” ""Indeed their policies have driven much of the uncontrolled increase. No doubt the public will bear this lamentable performance in mind when it comes to casting their vote at the next election."" Stephen Kinnock, Labour's shadow immigration minister, added: ""These new statistics set out in stark terms the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system. ""The asylum backlog has reached a new record high, with 175,000 people now waiting for decisions. ""With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day."" Cost of crisis The total cost of the asylum has now reached £3.97bn a year - up from £2.12 billion in 2021/22. In stark contrast, in 2012/13, the total was just £500 million. Millions of pounds every day is spent putting up asylum seekers in hotels while they wait for their cases to be decided. And the number of people coming to the UK in small boats has continued to grow. Backlog up The backlog of people waiting for a decision on whether they can stay in the UK has reached a new record high, the Home Office said today. 175,000 people were waiting for their initial decision - up 44 per cent from the year before. 4 Border Force picking up more arrivals earlier today Credit: Chris Eades 4 Another 341 people arrived in the UK on small boats yesterday (Wednesday) Credit: Getty It's the highest figure since 2010 when the current records began. The PM has vowed to eradicate the legacy backlog by the end of the year - the group of 90,000 people who have been waiting the longest for decisions. But the stats also showed that a huge seven in ten people were having their asylum applications rubber-stamped - up from around 30 per cent in previous years. Visas increased More skilled worker visas were issued in the last 12 months in a bid to fill gaps in the UK's economy. They were up by a third - with half a million people arriving to work in the last year. Study visas were also up by a third to 627,000 as people flocked here to study post-pandemic. The news comes after plans to slash the number of dependent visas who can come to the UK. Tory MP Jonathan Gullis, said: ""A lot of people will rightly be concerned to see another huge rise in skilled worker visas particularly as the thresholds in education have been reduced, so we will probably be continuing to rely on cheap foreign labour into the future, whenever there is a shortage. ""We should be taking big businesses head on and forcing them to upskill young people and adults looking to retrain to develop our own workforce within the UK."" A Home Office spokesperson said of the news out today: “The government’s focus is clear – we must stop the boats and prevent the unacceptable number of people risking their lives by making these dangerous and illegal crossings, which continue to place an unprecedented strain on our asylum system. “We’ve transformed our immigration system to work in our best interests by encouraging the best and brightest to come to the UK, to support the growth of the economy and boost prosperity, and we remain absolutely committed to reducing levels of immigration into this country.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/23640776/migrant-crisis-fresh-pressure-rishi-sunak-backlog-criminals/,http://web.archive.org/web/20240115002302/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/23640776/migrant-crisis-fresh-pressure-rishi-sunak-backlog-criminals/

Suella Braverman’s Home Office wants workers to face a £2,000 annual fee for using the NHS as well as a significant increase in the amount migrants must earn to qualify for a visa. But Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is resisting attempts to tighten the “generous” system in case it derails his attempts to put the economy back on track.

READ MORE: New Conservative MP in angry BBC clash on migrant cap bid [LATEST] Suella Braverman and Jeremy Hunt The Home Secretary yesterday told the Commons “immigration policy is under constant review”. Net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and those leaving - hit a record 606,000 last year. Tory MPs today (Monday) launched a report calling for more action to drastically reduce numbers. The New Conservatives said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour and argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. They set out a 12 point plan to cut numbers, including increasing the salary threshold for migrant workers and increasing the health surcharge. The Daily Express understands Home Office ministers have already floated both proposals but are frustrated at the resistance from the Treasury.

More info Visa and immigration applicants are currently charged £624 a year for using the health service. Raising that to £2,000 would be a “fairer” reflection of the costs, a source said. The minimum a skilled worker must earn to secure a visa in the UK is £26,200. But ministers believe that allows almost everyone who applies to qualify because it is set too low. The New Conservatives have called for it to be raised to £38,000. But the Treasury is said to fear that such measures will hit economic forecasts drawn up by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. Asked at the launch event for the migration report about tensions between the Home Office and the Treasury, Conservative MP James Daly said: “The Chancellor is a very reasonable man. “His stewardship of the economy is clearly taking us in the right direction. He is also a realistic man and he wants to respond to the needs of constituents around the country. There is always a balance to be had between what the Treasury desires and what other departments desire. But this is to such an extent now that I’m sure the Chancellor takes a very positive view of what we are saying.” Trending Ms Braverman was asked in the Commons about the possibility of raising the skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 a year. She said “net migration is too high” and that overall numbers needed to be reduced. We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review,” Ms Braverman added. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said the debate was “not just about GDP” but also includes “rapid social cultural change”, which needs to be “taken in the round”. He dismissed suggestions that universities will go bust as a result of the group’s recommendations that the rules around student visas are tightened up. “IT’S NOT THE JOB OF GOVERNMENT TO PROP UP PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS,” HE SAID. Sunak launches new Illegal Migration Bill Mr Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. He called for the Government to go “further” but denied suggestions that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. The group pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration. Mr Hunt said the Prime Minister had been “incredibly brave” with his tough new Illegal Migration Bill that will allow migrants arriving illegally to be swiftly deported. He added: “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said that “huge volume” of migration to towns and cities in the last decade “changes the culture very significantly”. “It’s very difficult for local cultures, local communities, local societies to keep up with that change. It’s the pace of change that people find difficult as well as the change itself.” Ms Cates said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” A Treasury source said it was “not aware” of any issue relating to migration reforms that the Treasury or Chancellor is “blocking.” Who are the new conservatives? The New Conservatives launched in May with a mission to help the party reflect the interests of red wall voters that backed the party for the first time. As well as migration, the group wants to focus on cuts to the army, the rise of the “woke” agenda and tax freezes that have left people worse off. Made up of around 25 MPs from the last two general election intakes, members say their philosophy can be summed up in the phrase “common sense for the common good”. It adds: “We share the patriotic, kind, no-nonsense values of the British people, and for policies that will make us a stronger, safer and more united country.” Devizes MP Danny Kruger and Miriam Cates, who represents Penistone and Stocksbridge, founded the group. MPs on the right of the party from across the north and Midlands have signed up, including Stoke-on-Trent North’s Jonathan Gullis, James Daly, who represents Bury North, the most marginal constituency in the country, and Peterborough’s Paul Bristow, a close ally of Boris Johnson. Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson was expected to speak at yesterday's (MON) migration event but journalists were told he had “a terrible sick bug” and was at home recovering. MPs on the group have faced accusations they are undermining Rishi Sunak by setting out their own policy manifesto. But they all insisted they were loyal to the Prime Minister and were simply sharing ideas about how to resolve the seemingly impossible problem of rising migration.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1787186/suella-braverman-jeremy-hunt-migrants-tory-split-uk-economy,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1787186/suella-braverman-jeremy-hunt-migrants-tory-split-uk-economy

The latest figures appear to realise Home Office predictions of a resurgence this spring after numbers plummeted over the colder months. In the first five months of this year 151 Albanians arrived by small boat, according to published data. But in the past week the running total has doubled to almost 300, as a further 150 migrants arrived in just seven days, Border Force sources said. SIGNS OF A RESURGENCE WILL ALARM RISHI SUNAK, WHO TWO WEEKS AGO SAID HIS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION PLAN 'IS STARTING TO WORK'. He voiced cautious optimism as arrivals showed a 20 per cent year-on-year dip. However, this year's arrivals are now just 10 per cent below the same point last year. Separate Home Office figures showed there were 333 arrivals – of all nationalities – across the Channel yesterday, bringing this year's running total to 10,472. At the same point last year the figure stood at 11,662.

Albanian arrivals went from 235 in the first three months of last year to 1,930 in the following quarter and 9,037 in the next one. From October to December they fell to 1,099 and then to 29 from January to March. Provisional data for April 1 to May 30 showed there were 122 Albanian arrivals.

Last month in the House of Lords, Mr Clarke backed the “extraordinary” small boats law and has reconfirmed his position as the Illegal Migration Bill is set for its third reading on Monday afternoon. Everyone knows that it is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here. Ken Clark Writing in The Telegraph, Mr Clarke said while he has advocated the benefits that migrants bring to Britain, “doing nothing about illegal immigration is not an option”. He said: “Importantly, in all the debate about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, no one has advanced an alternative. “I have listened keenly for an idea of how else we might deal with the mounting problem of irregular migration, but answer has come there none.” The flagship legislation passed through the House of Commons but has met fierce opposition in the Lords. It aims to ensure those who arrive in the UK without permission will be detained and promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda. Mr Clarke said he is not making his comments out of “slavish loyalty” and he has not always been an admirer of the Government. But he lauded the Government’s approach to welcoming in Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong. He said: “We are not becoming a walled-in, closed country. THAT IS A GOOD BRITISH CONTRIBUTION TO A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE OF THE WESTERN WORLD. “Everyone knows that (illegal migration) is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here.” It comes as 1,070 migrants crossed the Channel in 13 boats on Friday and in seven boats on Saturday, according to Home Office figures. That takes the provisional total for the year so far to over 12,500 people. Home Secretary Suella Braverman has been fighting to get her central policy of forcibly removing unauthorised arrivals to Rwanda off the ground after it was blocked by appeal judges.

No10’s flagship Illegal Migration Bill is in Parliament this week where it faces a fierce battle of “ping pong” between the Commons and the Lords. Mr Jenrick told The Sun on Sunday that leftie lords and MPs should cease their war on the borders plan. He said: ‘’We must take the tough action necessary to stop the illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings, and restore fairness and order to our immigration system. “Inaction is not an option. And those that oppose our plan to Stop the Boats have put forward no alternative. “Those who oppose this Bill - like Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour and Lib Dem MPs and peers trying to block it - are showing contempt towards hard-working communities across the UK are unfairly affected by illegal migration in their day to day lives. “They have no plan - as always they only carp from the sidelines. “Every MP and peer now faces a very simple choice: side with the law-abiding British public and back our Stop the Boats Bill, or continue to side with the people smugglers and the law breakers.” The Bill returns to the Commons today.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘THERESA MAY MOULDED HER POLITICAL CAREER AROUND SCAPEGOATING MIGRANTS.’ PHOTOGRAPH: WPA/GETTY IMAGES BUT THE CONSERVATIVES DID SUCCEED IN INFLAMING POPULAR PASSIONS AGAINST A DEMONISED FOREIGNER BLAMED FOR SAPPING PUBLIC SERVICES, MAKING IMMIGRATION A TOP PRIORITY FOR 44% OF VOTERS BY 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration

Speaking to the BBC, he said he had to look after taxpayers and his duty was to the British public over migrants. He added it was ""fair and reasonable"" to ask asylum seekers to share rooms in hotels in some circumstances. It follows a dispute with asylum seekers over their temporary accommodation in central London. Last week, about 40 asylum seekers were offered space in a Pimlico hotel, but refused to enter after being asked to sleep four people per room. Head of Westminster Council Adam Huq expressed his concern in a letter to the home secretary, saying people who ""are likely to have been through significant and traumatic events"" were being asked to share ""an inappropriately sized room with multiple strangers"". Asked about the case on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Jenrick said the government did not want to use hotels, arguing it was ""taking away valuable assets for the local business community... people's weddings and personal events have had to be cancelled"". ""But where we are using them, it's right that we get good value for money for the taxpayer,"" he added. ""And so if single adult males can share a room, and it's legal to do so, which will obviously depend on the size of the accommodation, then we'll ask people to do that,"" he added. However, he denied it was government policy for asylum seekers and migrants to be housed in shared rooms. HE ALSO SAID THE UK'S ASYLUM SYSTEM WAS ""RIDDLED WITH ABUSE"" AND THAT THE COUNTRY COULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE ""PERCEIVED AS A SOFT TOUCH"". Labour said in response: ""After 13 years of Tory failure, the asylum system isn't just broken - it's costing tax payers a fortune - only Labour has a proper plan to stop dangerous boat crossings."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made reducing the numbers coming to the UK illegally one of his key priorities. Part of his plan is to implement the Illegal Migration Bill, currently going through Parliament. It would give ministers new powers to remove anyone arriving in the UK illegally and stop them claiming asylum here. But it has attracted fierce criticism including from the Archbishop of Canterbury, who said it risked ""great damage"" to the UK's reputation. The BBC understands the Home Office estimates the plans in the bill could cost between £3bn and £6bn through spending on detention facilities, as well as ongoing accommodation and removals. Last year the number of people arriving in the UK in small boats via the English Channel hit over 45,000 - the highest number since figures were first collected in 2018. The government is trying different ways to accommodate the rising numbers of people who are coming to the UK, including housing people in barges or facilities on air bases. Mr Jenrick was keen to repeat his assertion that the government is taking a robust approach, and that by asking migrants to share rooms he wants to cut the costs to the taxpayer. But he was less keen to acknowledge that the backlog for asylum claims is extremely high, and that compared to a few years ago, it takes much longer for cases to be resolved. The problems with accommodation at 395 hotels around the country would be far less acute if there were fewer people stuck in the system. When it comes to how ministers handle the issues there are not many easy answers. But while Conservative ministers say they want to bring immigration down, they have presided over the numbers going up and up. There is a serious clash between the rhetoric and the reality.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65802335,http://web.archive.org/web/20241207145942/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65802335

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" from crossing the English Channel as one of his five pledges after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of hundreds of migrants in hotels after record numbers arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. The opposition Labour Party said Sunak had failed to clear the backlog of tens of thousands of asylum claims and that 7,600 people had crossed the English Channel so far this year - a total that is likely to increase over the summer months. Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving and a toughening of the country's stance on immigration can produce results. He said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country and that London was increasing its provision of accommodation for those awaiting immigration decisions. He said the government had secured two new vessels to house migrants to move them out of hotels. Sunak said so far this year, ""the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%"" and that Britain was now accepting one in 50 Albanian asylum cases compared with one in five previously. He urged parliament to pass his new Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for the swift detention and deportation of people arriving on small boats back to their homeland or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda. It is now in the upper house of parliament, where peers could try to weaken some its provisions. ""This won't be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it's so important that we change the law,"" he said. ""My policy is very simple: it is this country - and your government - who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. I WILL DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE IT. I said I would stop the boats and I meant it.""

Mr Hammond, now a Tory peer, said that the move could act to bring down stubbornly high inflation being driven by rising wages without the need for interest rate rises hammering homeowners. The former Remain campaigner lamented to LBC that when the UK was in the EU the single market and free movement would have allowed people to enter and work, but that that was no longer possible. 'That's not happening now. And I think the government has regarded any relaxation of migration rules as being politically toxic,' he said. 'But rising mortgage rates on the scale we're seeing is also politically toxic. I think we might have to have a debate about the balance between the two… 'I would guess there are plenty of people around now who are facing enormous personal financial pressures because of rising mortgage rates either now or anticipating them for when their current fixed rate deals. Mr Hammond, now a Tory peer, said that the move could act to bring down stubbornly high inflation being driven by rising wages without the need for interest rate rises hammering homeowners. Speculation is swirling that the Monetary Policy Committee might even opt for a 0.5 percentage point rise today from the current 4.5 per cent The average two-year mortgage has hit 6.15 per cent, while government borrowing has also become massively more expensive Shock figures yesterday showing prices still not slowing down have made a bump to 5 per cent a real possibility 'And that even if they were, in principle, people who liked the idea of tighter migration controls, might be willing to embrace the concept that a lower cost way of getting wage inflation down would be to soften the labour market rather than dampen the whole economy.' It came as Brits prepare for another hammer blow today with the Bank of England poised to hike rates for the 13th time in a row to curb rampant inflation. Markets are pricing in a 0.25 percentage point rise to 4.75 per cent when the latest decision by the Monetary Policy Committee is announced at noon. But shock figures yesterday showing prices still not slowing down have made a bump to 5 per cent a real possibility - heaping more agony on mortgage-payers. The respected IFS think-tank has warned that 1.4million people are set to lose a fifth of their disposable income due to the soaring costs. BoE governor Andrew Bailey has been coming under intense fire for failing to respond to inflation earlier, with some Treasury advisers arguing that Threadneedle Street now has no option but to force a recession. Rishi Sunak has batted away Tory demands for tax breaks or other support for homeowners from the government, and renewed his vow to CPI inflation by the end of the year. Labour has said banks should be obliged to let crippled mortgage-payers switch to interest-only or extend their terms - even though this hugely increases their liabilities in the long run. Panic was sparked when official figures showed headline inflation sticking at 8.7 per cent, defying expectations of a fall to 8.4 per cent and suggesting surging prices have become embedded in the economy. To hit Mr Sunak's target it will have to be slashed to no more than 5.4 per cent by the end of the year. Markets were particularly alarmed that core inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as food and energy, actually rose from 6.8 per cent to 7.1 per cent, driven in part by rising wages. Traders pushed up borrowing costs, assuming that the BoE will use its only tool to combat inflation and push up interest rates. The average two-year mortgage has hit 6.15 per cent, while government borrowing has also become massively more expensive raising questions about public services and Tory hopes of tax cuts this Autumn. Mr Sunak, who will hold a question and answer session with voters today, insisted inflation would be brought under control.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12222643/Ex-chancellor-Philip-Hammond-says-UK-RELAX-immigration-rules-avoid-recession.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12222643/Ex-chancellor-Philip-Hammond-says-UK-RELAX-immigration-rules-avoid-recession.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the Government must clamp down on attractive pull factors to prevent the UK being seen as a “soft touch”. People smugglers will often promise migrants jobs and housing if they pay them thousands of pounds to risk their lives and cross the English channel in flimsy dinghies. Mr Jenrick declared last night: “Making it harder for illegal migrants to work and operate in the UK is vital to deterring dangerous, unnecessary boat crossings. “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue. “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks, and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties.” Employers face fines of up to £45,000 for every illegal migrant they help - triple the previous amount of £15,000. Bosses who have been caught harbouring illegal migrants before could be hit with a £60,000 penalty for every worker who does not have the right to remain in the UK. Government officials say more must be done to prevent UK being seen as 'soft touch' The fines for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes will also rocket, the Home Office confirmed last night. Landlords will be fined £5,000 for every lodger and £10,000 for every occupier of a property. This will double for any repeat offenders. It was previously £80 per lodger and £1,000 for every occupier. The Home Office last night revealed 4,000 employers have been hit with civil penalties since 2018. But only 230 landlords have been fined for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes from them over the same five year period. Officials stated: “Increasing fines will deter employers and landlords from engaging in these illegal and dangerous practices, further deterring people from attempting to come to the UK illegally.” Migrants believe they will face harsher punishments in France than they will in UK, says Mr Jenrick Mr Jenrick told GB News: “We are [reducing the pull factors]. “That’s exactly the work I have been doing over the last six months with Suella Braverman. We have changed the accommodation people are staying in. “The Labour Party say they don’t like us using disused military sites and barges. My post bag from Labour MPs is claiming the accommodation is not luxurious enough. “I think we have to make sure the UK is not perceived to be a soft touch. “The overwhelming majority of the people coming in small boats are coming from France, from a safe country with a well functioning asylum system. “They are choosing to come to the UK and that must be in part because of the perception that the UK is a softer touch. “That is why we are changing accommodation. That is why we are making it harder to live and work illegally in the UK with a 50 per cent rise in the number of raids this year to try and close down bogus employers.” SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The first migrants are expected to arrive on the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge today after a series of delays. But Home Secretary Suella Braverman was dealt a blow as two ports refused permission for two cruise ships to berth and house asylum seekers. Mr Jenrick admitted: “We’re in conversation with a number of other ports and hoping that we can secure those very soon. “It's true that a couple of ports did back out, mostly because local Labour councils like in Birkenhead and in Leith in Edinburgh refused to support us, hypocritically actually if you look at the Leith example. “That's a Labour council that housed Ukrainian refugees on the same barge, same boat, but refused to house asylum seekers, all the time saying that they are a city of sanctuary.” Some 15,121 migrants have crossed the English Channel this year. But ministers and Border Force are braced for a surge in crossings as the weather improves this week. Trending Friday’s arrivals were the first since July 26 amid wind and rain in the Channel. Home Secretary Suella Braverman yesterday admitted that it is “going to be a tough Summer” as the weather improves. Mrs Braverman said: “I look closely at what the incoming flows are like, and we still have too many people coming across the Channel. We still need to honour our pledge to the British people to stop the boats.” But the Home Secretary refused to say whether the Government will stop the boats before the next election.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1799369/No10-to-punish-hiding-illegal-migrants,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1799369/No10-to-punish-hiding-illegal-migrants

It comes after a Daily Mail reporter, posing as an economic migrant, asked law firms for help applying for asylum. Two companies allegedly agreed to help devise fictional backstories aimed at increasing the success of a claim. Justice Secretary Alex Chalk has urged the regulator to use the ""full force of sanctions"" at its disposal. Writing to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Mr Chalk said: ""Solicitors are critical to the operation of a fair immigration system. I know that the overwhelming majority take their professional duties and obligations extremely seriously. ""However, any examples of practices which fall short of the high ethical standards we expect of solicitors risk serious disruption to the immigration system, tarnishing the reputation of those working in this area, and critically undermining public confidence.""

As a result of the information provided, we are looking to take urgent action to make sure the public are protected. ""If we find evidence that solicitors or firms we regulate have acted in ways that contravene our rules, and in particular their duty to act legally and uphold the law, we can and will take action."" Last November, the regulator carried out a review of the immigration and asylum sector which concluded it was generally ""satisfied with the quality of service being provided"". Following the review it issued new guidance on immigration work and committed to producing a further report in 12 to 18 months. Mr Chalk said the follow-up review should be carried out ""as soon as possible"". The Solicitors Regulation Authority monitors more than 200,000 solicitors in England and Wales.

In an interview with Sky News, the unnamed asylum seeker said he was meant to board on August 1, but he has sought a legal intervention due to his age and physical and mental health grounds. On Monday, 15 people spent their first night on the vessel, docked in Portland Port, but 20 refused to board due to a 'severe fear of water', according to their lawyers. The asylum seeker said being 'squeezed into a small space' on the barge would remind him of hiding from the Islamic State group (IS) - and would be similar to what he had escaped from back home. The man said: 'We are all running away from war, trauma and conflict. A Syrian asylum seeker has said living on the Bibby Stockholm barge (pictured in Portland Port today) would remind him of hiding from ISIS 'We're looking for more space so if you put me and squeeze me into a smaller place, you are putting me back into that small room where I was hiding when ISIS were attacking our area. 'So it just reminded me again that we are in a two metre by two metre room and ISIS troops are around and you have to hide.' He was told only at the end of July that he would be moved onto the barge from a hotel he had been living in for six months in Bournemouth. The vessel's previous capacity of 222 has been doubled to 500 by putting bunk beds in its cabins and converting some communal rooms into dormitories for four to six men. However the idea has been slammed by campaign groups and charities and 'shameful' and likely to be a 're-traumatising' experience for those who have had to flee from their home countries. In an open letter to Bibby Marine, the barge owner, over 40 organisations called the housing 'cruel and inhumane.' And Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK's refugee and migrant rights director, said: 'It seems there's nothing this Government won't do to make people seeking asylum feel unwelcome and unsafe in this country. 'Reminiscent of the prison hulks from the Victorian era, the Bibby Stockholm is an utterly shameful way to house people who've fled terror, conflict and persecution. The unnamed asylum seeker told Sky News in an interview that being 'squeezed' into the small rooms would remind him of hiding from ISIS People board the Bibby Stockholm immigration barge on August 8 in Portland Port - after 20 refused People are seen carrying rucksacks and plastic bags as they climb aboard the Bibby Stockholm today The Bibby Stockholm is seen moored in Portland this morning 'Housing people on a floating barge is likely to be re-traumatising and there should be major concerns about confining each person to living quarters the typical size of a car parking space.' MEANWHILE 20 OTHERS HAVE REFUSED TO BOARD THE BIBBY STOCKHOLM DUE TO A 'SEVERE FEAR OF WATER', ACCORDING TO THEIR LAWYERS. Asylum seekers have been warned they must board the barge today or have their free accommodation withdrawn after 15 spent their first night on the vessel. The group's transfer onto the barge was 'cancelled' on Monday after legal challenges from representatives of Care4Calais claimed the Home Office had not screened them to see if it was suitable to put them there. The charity's CEO Steve Smith has since revealed that some of the asylum seekers it supported didn't board the vessel yesterday due to 'mental health concerns', some of which arose from being 'traumatised by seeing their friends drown at sea'. The legal firm behind the last-minute legal challenges is understood to be London-based Duncan Lewis, which played a key role in challenging the Government's Rwanda asylum scheme. However, it is understood that those who refuse to be transferred will be given 24 hours to change their minds before the Home Office considers withdrawing their free, full-board accommodation. In that event, they would be declared homeless and responsibility for their housing would pass to their local authority. More asylum seekers are set to arrive on the barge (pictured) over the course of the day A bus arrives at Portland Port in Dorset this morning Today, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk acknowledged it is 'frustrating' that just 15 migrants had boarded the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm following the legal challenges.

It requires a huge amount of time and effort and organisation to procure these alternatives,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'I think the British people would expect their Government to do that if it is our cheaper alternative... it doesn't diminish our resolve to solve this.' He later told Sky News: 'This is about fairness - yes to migrants - but also the British people. 'We are clear that it's safe and reasonable that people should be provided with acceptable accommodation but not accommodate that goes beyond that and costs a huge amount of money.' The migrants transferred to the barge came from hotels in Oxford, Bristol, Torbay and Bournemouth, as the government's solution to its rocketing £6million-a-day hotel bill for new arrivals was put into action. It will eventually house 500 men aged 18 to 65 as they wait for their asylum applications to be processed. Addressing the asylum seekers who were appealing against being moved to the barge, Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said: 'If they don't like barges then they should f*** off back to France.' Mr Chalk later defended his comments, telling LBC: 'Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that's his style, but his indignation is well placed.' The Justice Secretary said France is a safe country and a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. 'People should claim asylum in the first country - it's not like there should be an open shopping list of where you want to go,' he said. 'He expresses himself in his characteristically robust terms but there is a lot of sense, in my respectful view, in what Lee says.' At the port yesterday, campaigners brought flowers and welcome packs containing basic toiletries and other useful items, including a map of the area. But they were not able to give these directly to the migrants and had to leave them with security staff at the port gate. But one man vox-popped by the BBC News at 10 said they have 'en-suite showers, they're getting three cooked meals a day. Really they're living like kings.' Yesterday, new figures showed the number of migrants staying in hotels has hit 50,000, a 25 per cent increase from 40,000 in December, when Rishi Sunak promised to end the placement of asylum seekers in hotels. Ministers confirm Rwanda 'Plan B' talks Ministers last night confirmed alternative plans are being drawn up in case the Rwanda asylum deal is blocked by the courts. It came after the Daily Mail revealed yesterday that Channel migrants could be sent to Ascension Island for processing as part of a radical 'Plan B'. As a further fall-back, up to five other countries – all believed to be in Africa – are in negotiations to take asylum seekers. Home Office minister Sarah Dines said the Government was examining 'additional schemes across the globe'. Former business secretary Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said housing migrants on Ascension, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic, was previously ruled out as it would cost £1million a head and was 'thought to be impossibly expensive to do'. The £140million Rwanda deal, which involves sending migrants to the east African nation to claim asylum there rather than here, was blocked on human rights grounds by the Court of Appeal in June. Ms Dines said the Government was 'confident' it will be declared lawful, with the Supreme Court due to hear the Home Office's appeal in October, and a ruling expected six to eight weeks later. Ascension was first looked at as a possible location for a processing centre in 2021. As it is British soil, it would remove some of the legal difficulties involved in deporting migrants to a foreign state. But it is understood the plans were abandoned largely due to objections from the US military, which has a presence on the island. A source familiar with the initial negotiations said: 'The Americans didn't want people poking around there. 'You'd be sending migrants... whose affiliations are unclear. You wouldn't be able to detain them, and they'd be free to roam on the island.' The 34-square-mile territory has no hospital and moving large numbers of migrants and staff there could overload existing power and water facilities.

All bedrooms have TVs but they are not attached to aerials so can only be used by wiring them to another device, such as a laptop, while free Wi-Fi is available throughout the barge at a speed of 1gb per second. Those living onboard will take part in activities including cricket, cycling, tending allotments and going on guided hikes in the Dorset countryside. They will also take part in organised 'cultural events' and get free buses and taxis to enjoy local towns. Buses every hour from 7am to 11pm will ferry men to Weymouth, a nearby seaside resort with a beach, fishing boat fleet and marina. If they miss the 11pm bus back to the barge, free taxis are available by phoning a special number. On top of free food, accommodation and transport, each migrant is given £9.58 a week pocket money. Speaking on Monday, Mr Smith revealed that none of the 20 migrants his charity was supporting had gone to the barge as 'legal representatives have had their transfers cancelled'. 'These 20 range from survivors of torture to people who have been beaten, shot at, some arrested, some traumatised by seeing their friends drown at sea and who therefore have a severe fear of water,' he told The Telegraph. 'There are therefore mental health concerns and a very worried and very traumatised community. Details of those individuals have been passed to lawyers who have raised challenges about the suitability screening. 'There appears to have been no suitability screening. I understand that on that basis some removals to the barge have ceased.' Speaking elsewhere, he added: 'To house any human being in a ''quasi floating prison'' like the Bibby Stockholm is inhumane. 'To try and do so with this group of people is unbelievably cruel. Even just receiving the notices is causing them a great deal of anxiety.' The Stand Up To Racism campaign group said the asylum seekers who avoided transfer to the barge included nine housed in Bournemouth. A government source said: 'This just shows what we are up against: Left-wing charities and lawyers are repeatedly trying to stop us from moving illegal migrants out of expensive hotels. 'Other European countries use barges safely and at lower costs than hotels. Labour need to quit trying to sabotage our plans to stop the boats. It's time they backed the barge.' Yesterday, Portland resident Ian Broadhurst got into a heated debate with the Stand Up To Racism campaigners asking why they were giving help to strangers instead of helping poverty-stricken islanders. Mr Broadhurst, who does charity work with the local food bank and community fridge, said: 'This isn't being racist, this is saying we need to look after ourselves. We cannot afford them here when we can't even look after our own people.' Home Office minister Sarah Dines said the vessel - which previously housed oil and gas workers - would provide 'basic but proper accommodation' and that those who arrive in the UK by illegal means 'can't expect to stay in a four-star hotel'. She told the BBC on Monday: 'What it sends is a forceful message that there will be proper accommodation but not luxurious.

There have been promises made abroad by the organised criminal gangs and organisations which have tried to get people into the country unlawfully and they say, ''You will be staying in a very nice hotel in the middle of a town in England''. 'That needs to stop and the barge is just one of a wide range of other measures.'

She also confirmed 'all possibilities' for tackling the migrant crisis are being examined, following reports that the Government is considering reviving plans to fly people who arrive by unauthorised means 4,000 miles to Ascension Island. While only a small number of migrants are expected to be housed on the barge at first, Ms Dines suggested it could increase rapidly to its capacity of around 500 men. Pressed on whether all of them could be on board by the end of the week, Ms Dines said: 'Yes, quite possibly it will be 500. We are hoping.' But Downing Street appeared to suggest she had misspoken, with the Prime Minister's official spokesman saying that while 'no limit' had been set on how many people would board the barge this week, the Government's plan was to reach the capacity 'over time', adding: 'I don't think we are aiming to do it by the weekend.' The Home Office later clarified the total would be reached over a longer period of time and not by the end of the week. Police stand guard as a coach arrives at the front gates by Bibby Stockholm in Portlandon on Monday Campaigners brought bunches of flowers and welcome packs containing toiletries and other useful items to give them to asylum seekers arriving on the barge The group were not able to give these directly to the migrants and had to leave them with security staff at the port gate Some of the brown card bags containing bunches of flowers A range of meals will be served from the barge's canteen. Food is available 24 hours a day, including breakfast and a three-course lunch and dinner Those on board the controversial barge can make the most of comfortable sofas in the TV room Some of the residents who are against the barge say they are disgusted with the Government for ignoring their concerns about public safety and the impact the migrants will have on already overstretched local resources. It is believed Portland Port, a private enterprise, will receive £2.5million from the arrangement with the Home Office. Dorset Council and NHS Dorset are also being paid £3million for laying on extra services, healthcare and activities for them. Money will also be spent on beefing CCTV in the area and paying for additional community safety officers. Members of the Stand Up To Racism group, claimed that most asylum seekers don't want to stay on the barge. One member said: 'Every asylum seeker who got in touch with Care4Calais and told them they didn't want to go to the barge has successfully made a case. 'There were nine in Bournemouth. They have been taken off the list but one has chosen to come. 'They have been there at least four months, they've got support networks in Bournemouth, they've made a life there and they don't know anything about Portland. One said he had seen some of the hate online and was very scared.' The new arrivals will be given an 'induction' to help them understand 'what is expected in the community'. It is understood instructions on being 'a good neighbour' will include advice not to crowd together in large groups, not to carry weapons and to avoid entering children's playgrounds.

Breakfast choices include eggs, pancakes, bread and yoghurts; lunch options include potato soup, garlic chicken, Irish stew, and roast turkey with rice, and dinner choices include paella, fried fish and oriental chicken. Pictures show bottles of Ribena and Heinz tomato ketchup. In the middle of the barge are two outdoor recreational areas, each about 80ft by 30ft, where there are plans to host 'basketball, netball and volleyball' matches. There is a classroom for English language lessons, a computer room with free WiFi and a medical room with a nurse, and a GP on call. Concerns have been raised over fire safety arrangements on the barge, with only two main exits across the three decks. But Ms Dines insisted that the Bibby Stockholm barge was a 'safe place' for asylum seekers to be housed after it was put to her that safety checks had caused their arrival on the vessel to be delayed. Ms Dines told LBC: 'It is a safe place for people to live and stay. It is a very complex situation. 'Let us just be clear that the Government is determined to use barges such as this one to make sure we have somewhere which is proper - rudimentary but proper - accommodation for migrants.' Labour has repeatedly flip-flopped over its position on the barge, with shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock telling BBC Breakfast on Sunday that barges would continue to be used if his party won the next general election. But shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds was non-committal when repeatedly asked whether Labour supports the use of the Bibby Stockholm. Bedrooms on board contain a wardrobe as well as a small desk, chair and television The barge - moored in Portland - also offers a multifaith room A view of the doctor's room onboard the Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge Asked if Labour supports the use of the barge, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We do not wish to run and will not run an asylum system that requires the use of bases, barges or indeed of hotels, those are being used as additional accommodation because of the failure of the Conservatives to run our asylum system properly over many years.' On whether Labour supports people being moved onto the barge, he said: 'Look, I am in favour of there being safe and secure accommodation. Now there have been some concerns raised by fire experts over this barge that it's important that the Home Office address, I'm obviously not close enough to those conversations, I can't individually say whether that safety standard has been met in every single case.' Asked if he objects to the barge being used if safety standards have been met, he said: 'Government has to place people in safe accommodation, that's clear. In terms of where Labour would be, we're not in Government today, much as I would like us to be. 'Our position is we would get that backlog down. With respect, I'm not in Government today sitting there around that Cabinet table to be able to say individually which particular parts of this extra accommodation Government failure is necessitating is safe or unsafe, there have been concerns raised which the Home Office has to address.' Professor Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), has said its officials will visit the Bibby Stockholm barge 'once the migrants are there to check out some of the infection prevention control'. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The health of those on board is very much for the Home Office, when migrants enter the country they go into Home Office accommodation initially and then when they are moved to a local area that is a link with the local NHS, so my understanding is most of those initially at least going onto the Bibby Stockholm will actually have had a health assessment before they arrive there. 'And we work very closely with the Home Office in anticipation, indeed we have on this particular event.'

The PSP Cormoran is understood to have been tracking a number of small boats in rough conditions six miles off the French coast early yesterday morning, according to a well-informed source. A SECOND FRENCH VESSEL WAS BELIEVED TO BE CLOSE BY AT THE TIME OF THE TRAGEDY. One of the small boats capsized as it entered a busy shipping lane and almost 70 people were thrown into the water. Six died and two more are thought to be missing. The presence of the French vessels sparked a furious political row as Tory MPs accused the French authorities of encouraging desperate migrants to attempt the perilous crossing in bad weather. ‘The boat was being escorted towards Britain by a French navy patrol vessel when it capsized,’ the source told The Mail on Sunday. ‘This is a French policy designed to ensure the migrants make it to British waters as safely and quickly as possible.’ Furious MPs tonight questioned why France was not doing more to tackle the crisis, given that the UK is giving the country almost £500 million to help stop the crossings. SAVED: Migrants whose boat capsized on a French rescue ship today The RNLI brought 50 survivors into Dover docks this morning ‘We should get that money back,’ one senior Tory MP said. Today's incident – the worst loss of life in the Channel since November 2021 when 27 migrants perished – was last night described as a ‘wake-up call’ for Labour and Left-wing lawyers blocking Government plans to solve the small-boats crisis. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘Surely we must do everything to deter them from making that decision and making that perilous crossing. It is a wake-up call for all those who speak only of rights, but seem incapable of balancing those rights against the terrible risks that people are undertaking as they pay their life savings to be shoved on to a boat that is unseaworthy, only to find that it all ends somewhere in the channel.’ Tory MP Marco Longhi, a member of the Home Affairs Committee, added: ‘This terrible tragedy should be a wake-up call to Sir Keir Starmer, Labour and the whole of the Left, that this is what happens when they oppose the Government’s sensible measures to tackle the small-boats crisis. ‘I hope to God that the Labour leader now sees this and changes his obstructionist approach as soon as possible. People’s lives depend on it.’ After another day of tragedy in the Channel, the MoS can reveal: Vile traffickers were attempting to lure more migrants to undertake the perilous crossing just hours after the deaths. Despite the accident, over 500 migrants crossed the Channel yesterday, making it the fourth busiest day of 2023. At least four other boats were escorted into English waters by French warships in the hours after the tragedy, it is claimed. The small boats are more crowded than ever, according to a senior Border Force source. People smugglers are refusing to give life jackets to some migrants, despite charging up to £5,000 for a seat on one of the packed boats. The incident ended a disastrous week in which Rishi Sunak had hoped to persuade the public that he was getting on top of the Channel crisis. His efforts were first derailed on Thursday after it emerged the number of people who have crossed the Channel in the past five and a half years had passed an astonishing 100,000. Paramedics assist a migrant picked up at sea while attempting to cross the English Channel The P677 Cormoran Flamant-class patrol vessel of the French Navy sails on Calais' harbour The Government’s migrant policy then descended into farce the following day when asylum seekers on the Bibby Stockholm barge were evacuated after legionella was found on board. Tory MP Tom Hunt said tonight: ‘One could think it’s more safe that the French are escorting them. ‘However the net effect is likely to encourage more to attempt the unsafe crossing as it provides a veneer of security. Which, as we’ve seen this week, can tragically count for little.’ Sir Iain branded France’s policy of escorting small boats to British waters as ‘madness’. ‘That acts as an incentive for them to make the crossing and take the risk,’ he said. ‘I think the whole thing encourages them to risk the journey more, which is a mistake – you see what happens when they do that. They end up dying.’ Yesterday’s incident took place off the coast of Sangatte. The MoS understands that several small boats set off from France despite a forecast of windy and rough sea conditions. Fisherman Matthew Coker said radar tracking data suggested two French warships were tracking the boats as they headed to English waters. The PSP Cormoran is understood to have been the closer of the two vessels to the boat that sunk, while the PSP Pluvier was further away. People smuggler video advert for crossing the English Channel, dated August 12 ‘Two French boats – both warships – were in that exact area at that time,’ Mr Coker told the MoS. ‘They were escorting boats.’ Early yesterday morning, both warships changed direction and immediately headed to where the small boat is believed to have capsized. French authorities confirmed that the Cormoran rescued 33 survivors, while the Pluvier rescued five. Five migrants – all thought to be Afghan men – died at the scene and their bodies were brought back to Calais. Another Afghan man in his early 20s was airlifted to a hospital in Le Touquet, but was pronounced dead on arrival. A total of 58 migrants were rescued, with most taken back to Calais, and more than a dozen brought to Dover by British rescuers. Anne Thorel, a volunteer on a French rescue boat, described the migrants’ frantic efforts to bail water out of their sinking vessel with their shoes. ‘There were too many of them on the boat.’ Another French rescuer, who did not want to be named, said many of the migrants on the boat did not have life jackets. ‘One man was very lucky,’ he said. ‘He was drowning, but the rescuers pulled him into the boat by his neck. He did not have a life jacket.’ A witness in Dover said four ambulances and one paramedic car rushed to the port area where migrants were brought in just after 6.30am. Paramedics put oxygen masks on some of the survivors as they were treated on the quayside. ‘It was distressing to watch,’ he said. ‘I saw a lot of migrants who had their faces and heads covered with blankets. But the ones whose faces I saw, they looked as if they were crying. Even some of the paramedics looked distressed.’ Mr Coker said he regularly saw French naval vessels escorting migrant boats. He said that last Thursday around six migrants fell into the sea just inside English waters after being accompanied by a French vessel named Argonaute. Instead of rescuing the migrants, the French vessel waited for 20 minutes until an RNLI lifeboat arrived, he claimed. Mr Coker added that people smugglers did not risk launching boats in rough weather before the French began providing escorts around three years ago. ‘When they were leaving in the dark and they had no escorts they would never, ever have attempted to cross on a day like today. That did not happen.’ Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: ‘My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic loss of life in the Channel today.’ Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the incident was an ‘appalling, deeply shocking tragedy’. A French navy spokesman declined to comment, saying a criminal inquiry had been opened by the Boulogne prosecutor and Maritime Prefecture.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12401039/Was-French-patrol-boat-fault-Channel-migrant-drownings-MPs-ask-dinghy-escorted-British-waters-tragedy-saw-six-die.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12401039/Was-French-patrol-boat-fault-Channel-migrant-drownings-MPs-ask-dinghy-escorted-British-waters-tragedy-saw-six-die.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Officials will now treat them the same as those who arrived through safe and legal routes. A senior source branded it a “de facto amnesty as a means of processing more cases”. Home Office figures showed that 172,758 people were waiting for an initial decision on asylum applications at the end of March, up 57 per cent from a year earlier and the highest figure since comparable records began in 2010. Tens of thousands who arrived between June 28 and July 2023 will be allowed to stay in the UK for up to five years. READ MORE: Sadiq Khan vows to fight plan to house migrants at docks 172,758 people were waiting for an initial decision on asylum applications at the end of March Previously, migrants who arrived illegally were put in “Group 2”, meaning they could only remain in the UK for 30 months. The Home Office introduced the “differentiation” last year to incentivise migrants not to pay people smugglers thousands to reach the UK. Refugees classed as “Group One” are “normally” granted permission to stay for five years and can apply for their families to come to the UK. They have “immediate and unrestricted access to the labour market” and have “full access” to the family reunion route to bring their families to the UK once their asylum application is successful. A source said: “Losing the differentiation aspect between those who come through safe routes and those who do not does not look like getting a grip of the system or having a strong deterrent.” But a Home Office source described it as an “administrative change” to avoid staff wasting time separating applicants. HOTEL NEAR HEATHROW HOUSES ASYLUM SEEKERS AWAITING CLAIM PROCESSING IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK SAID: “THE DIFFERENTIATION POLICY WAS INTENDED TO DISINCENTIVISE MIGRANTS FROM USING CRIMINAL SMUGGLERS TO FACILITATE ILLEGAL JOURNEYS TO THE UK. “This was the right approach. Since then, the scale of the challenge facing the UK, like other countries, has grown – and that is why the Government introduced the Illegal Migration Bill.” Under the Government’s new Illegal Migration Bill, asylum claims from migrants who arrive on small boats will be thrown out. Ministers insisted the only “humanitarian route” into the UK is through a safe and legal route.” Mr Jenrick said: “This approach represents a considerably stronger means of tackling the same issue that the differentiation policy sought to address: people making dangerous and unnecessary journeys through safe countries to claim asylum in the UK. “We will therefore pause the differentiation policy in the next package of Immigration Rules changes in July 2023.” In another move to slash the asylum backlog, the Home Office has also expanded a “streamlined” application process. This will apply to people from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Sudan. Case workers will be able to approve applications without a further review.

The oldest asylum seeker yet discovered pretending to be a child was actually found to be 41, Robert Jenrick said. He told MPs that medical assessments - thought to include X-rays or MRI scans - will initially run in parallel with existing tests which are based on behavioural and language studies. ‘That will happen over the course of this year,’ Mr Jenrick told MPs in the Commons. ‘The oldest individual that we’ve encountered who posed as a child was subsequently found to be 41 years of age. ‘We do take the issue of age assessment extremely seriously. Scientific age assessments of migrants who claim to be children will start this year, the immigration minister Robert Jenrick confirmed today Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai (pictured) who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year ‘There are individuals who abuse the system - that’s wrong as a matter of principle but it’s also a serious safeguarding risk to genuine children. ‘It’s important that we weed out those cases of abuse because it poses such a risk. ‘I’m afraid we’ve seen some very tragic instances such as the murder that occurred in Bournemouth at the behest of somebody who had posed as a child.’ Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year. Abdulrahimzai was on the run from murder charges in Serbia when he arrived in Britain, and was later convicted in his absence of gunning down two people with a Kalashnikov assault rifle. The Home Office commissioned a report, published in January, which said migrants suspected of pretending to be children could undergo a range of medical tests to determine their true age. It recommended a combination of X-rays of the wisdom teeth and the hand or wrist, plus MRI scans of the knee or collarbone. The move may prove controversial because medics have opposed the use of X-rays for non-medical reasons. Other shocking cases in which adult asylum seekers claimed to be children include Ahmad Otak who in 2012 forced his ex-girlfriend to watch him murder her sister and her friend after she refused to take him back. Mr Roberts was murdered by Abdulrahimzai following an argument over a scooter in Bournemouth A court heard the Afghan lied about his age to get preferential treatment from social services, but Otak was actually 22. Others include Parson’s Green terrorist Ahmed Hassan, who posed as a 16-year-old before setting off a bomb on a Tube train in west London in 2017, injuring 23 people. A judge said he was satisfied the bomber was between 18 and 21. Other adult migrants have ended up in schools being taught alongside young teenage children. Migrants who claim to be under 18 receive better housing and support, a more sympathetic hearing in their asylum claim and are less likely to be detained. Under current rules, local authorities are not allowed to carry out physical examinations of asylum seekers suspected of lying about their age. Instead, social workers estimate the person’s age by assessing their behaviour and language skills. In 2021 the British Dental Association said it ‘vigorously opposed’ using dental X-rays to establish asylum seekers’ ages.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

SUELLA BRAVERMAN'S DEPARTMENT SET A TARGET TO LOCATE 500 BEDS A WEEK IN CHEAPER ACCOMMODATION – BUT SECURED JUST 48 BEDS A WEEK ON AVERAGE IN THE YEAR TO APRIL. The report by spending watchdogs raised serious concerns over the Government's ability to meet its pledges on tackling the asylum crisis. The National Audit Office said it was 'unclear' whether PM Rishi Sunak's pledge to slash the backlog by December was 'sustainable'. 'Dispersal' accommodation – such as self-catering flats – costs the taxpayer £14.41 a night on average, compared with £145 a night for an asylum hotel. The report, published today, also revealed the Home Office planned to have sent hundreds of asylum seekers to Rwanda or another safe country by now – but due to legal challenges the first flight has yet to take off. Suella Braverman's department set a target to locate 500 beds a week in cheaper accommodation. The Home Secretary is pictured at No 10, June 15 Currently, 45,000 migrants are in hotels at a cost of £6million a day. In September, the Home Office envisioned ending the use of hotels by December – but it has 'since reduced its ambition'. Amid a mountain of 173,000 asylum claims, the auditors revealed that in April this year only half of the Home Office's 1,270 caseworkers were 'deciding claims' – the rest were still 'in training' or 'absent'. In fact, just 140 were 'fully trained and working independently'. Mr Sunak pledged in December that 92,000 'legacy' asylum claims lodged before June 28 last year would be 'abolished' by the end of this year. The backlog has fallen to 78,954, but the overall total is rising by the day. The Home Office has set up a programme to reduce costs – but the NAO said the scheme is 'not on track'. Meanwhile, it spent £3.6billion on asylum costs, including accommodation, last year – double the previous year's sum. A bombshell report has revealed the Home Office secured just 48 beds a week on average in the year to April.

The Home Office said the unit will bring together regulatory bodies, law enforcement teams and other Government departments to take action against advocates found to be deceiving the courts. It comes after the Daily Mail reported that a number of solicitors agreed to help an undercover journalist posing as an economic migrant submit a false application in exchange for thousands of pounds. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice But the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. It added that the Home Office is focusing on a “tiny minority of lawyers” rather than “significant” asylum claim backlogs and “the unworkability of the Illegal Migration Act”. The Home Office said the Professional Enablers Taskforce, for which there is no new funding, has been carrying out preliminary work over the past few months. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity, according to the department. Police referrals have also been made where criminal activity is suspected, the Home Office said, with those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means facing life imprisonment. The maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration is already life imprisonment under the Immigration Act 1971. JUSTICE SECRETARY AND FORMER BARRISTER ALEX CHALK SAID PROFESSIONALS SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED “IMMUNITY” FROM THE LAW “SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE LAWYERS”, TELLING GB NEWS HE IS “ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE” WITH THE CRACKDOWN. The announcement came after the first 15 migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson was reported to have said asylum seekers complaining about the barge, moored off the Dorset coast, should “f*** off back to France”. Home Secretary Suella Braverman, speaking about the task force, said: “Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice. “While the majority of lawyers act with integrity, we know that some are lying to help illegal migrants game the system. It is not right or fair on those who play by the rules. “The British people want us to put an end to illegal migration – I am determined to crack down on these immoral lawyers and stop the boats.” Speaking to the Daily Mail, Ms Braverman said: “These conmen make it far harder to remove people who have no right to be here, and they must face the full force of the law. “I want to see the worst offenders in jail, and we have the laws in place to bring them to justice. “I know our teams are working incredibly hard to root out those who game our asylum system and cheat the British public – this can’t go on.” Mr Chalk said: “The accuracy and honesty of legal advice underpins the integrity of our world-leading legal system, so those who undermine it by encouraging deception must be held to account. “This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.” Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system But Richard Atkinson, deputy vice president of the Law Society, said: “This ‘task force’ has been around for months now, so it is not clear what, if anything, the Government is announcing today.” He added: “The Government, regulators and law enforcement agencies already have the powers they need to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. “The overwhelming majority of immigration lawyers continue to support the rule of law through their adherence to the law and professional standards set by the Solicitors Regulation Authority and provide an essential service to clients. “The focus of the Home Office on a tiny minority of lawyers to which they are apparently applying considerable resources should not deflect from the fact that there remains significant backlogs in asylum claims or the unworkability of the Illegal Migration Act.” Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC said lawyers must observe ethical and conduct rules which apply to them while advising and representing their clients, with appropriate sanctions if they breach them. He said: “The task force must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers.” For Labour, shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said it is “too little too late” and the “buck stops” with the Conservatives, accusing them of having “sat idly by for 13 years while illegal migration has spun out of control”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” The first asylum seekers arrived at the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland on Monday, with the Home Office saying people are expected to be housed there for between three and nine months. Cheryl Avery, the Home Office’s director for asylum accommodation, confirmed 15 people were moved on to the vessel as part of the Government’s bid to cut the cost of hotel bills by finding other accommodation, which also includes former military bases. Care4Calais said around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Tory MP Mr Anderson, on those complaining about the accommodation, told Express.co.uk: “If they don’t like barges then they should f*** off back to France.” He added: “I think people have just had enough. “These people come across the Channel in small boats… if they don’t like the conditions they are housed in here then they should go back to France, or better not come at all in the first place.” Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/suella-braverman-lee-anderson-home-office-law-society-government-b1099232.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230920104857/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/suella-braverman-lee-anderson-home-office-law-society-government-b1099232.html

In a letter to Home Secretary Suella Braverman, the Mayor of London said the bill was “cruel and unworkable” and that it would leave tens of thousands of people stranded in the capital without support. The Government has said the bill “will change the law so that those who arrive in the UK illegally will not be able to stay here and will instead be detained and then promptly removed, either to their home country or a safe third country”. But Mr Khan said he was concerned the proposed law changes “would do significant damage to vulnerable people seeking sanctuary and put already-stretched services in London on crisis footing”. The mayor warned the bill could “end up handing power to human traffickers, undermine crucial child protections, and leave people in immigration limbo, rather than have their requests for sanctuary heard”. Referring to scenes in Pimlico last week, Mr Khan added that people had recently been seen “seeking sanctuary camped outside hotels, rather than suffer overcrowded, substandard conditions”. The mayor told Ms Braverman: “It is clear that the current asylum system is broken and this bill will serve only to deepen the challenge, which could result in 50,000 people over the next three years left in London, unable to access support, work or legitimate avenues to fend for themselves.” Mr Khan’s warning follows an assessment from the Refugee Council which estimated that tens of thousands of children will be impacted if the bill becomes a law, and around £9 billion will be spent nationally on detaining and accommodating people impacted by the bill in the first three years of its operation. The Home Office has been approached for comment. Ms Braverman’s department has previously said: “Our current modern slavery laws are being abused by people with no right to be here determined to frustrate their removal from the UK… “If someone is found to be a genuine victim of modern slavery – meaning they have been trafficked to the UK against their will – we will ensure they are safely returned to their home country or another safe country like Rwanda. “In Rwanda people will have support and care, meeting their needs as their asylum claims are processed and considered. This includes safe and clean accommodation, food, healthcare, recreation and other amenities. They will not be detained.” The Home Office has also previously said: “Inadmissibility and removal to a safe third country is a longstanding process in the UK asylum system, that have [sic] been applied in the UK for many years… “It is also an established part of international asylum procedures, employed by other countries, including the EU where it is operated under the Dublin Regulation. “Those who fear persecution should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and not put their lives at risk by making unnecessary and dangerous journeys to the UK.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/sadiq-khan-suella-braverman-illegal-migration-bill-homeless-b1085739.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230608094330/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/sadiq-khan-suella-braverman-illegal-migration-bill-homeless-b1085739.html

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER {{ /VERIFYERRORS }} A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD TEMPORARILY CONTINUE WITH THE GOVERNEMNT'S PLAN TO HOUSE REFUGEES ON BARGES MOORED OFFSHORE, THE PARTY'S IMMIGRATION MINISTER HAS SAID. Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Suella Braverman’s Home Office wants workers to face a £2,000 annual fee for using the NHS as well as a significant increase in the amount migrants must earn to qualify for a visa. But Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is resisting attempts to tighten the “generous” system in case it derails his attempts to put the economy back on track. A source said: ""The points-based system is far too generous. Other countries think we are too generous. ""We need to make changes to make it tougher, such as on the health surcharge and raising the salary threshold, but the Treasury is the block."" READ MORE: New Conservative MP in angry BBC clash on migrant cap bid [LATEST] Suella Braverman and Jeremy Hunt The Home Secretary yesterday told the Commons “immigration policy is under constant review”. Net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and those leaving - hit a record 606,000 last year. Tory MPs today (Monday) launched a report calling for more action to drastically reduce numbers. The New Conservatives said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour and argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. They set out a 12 point plan to cut numbers, including increasing the salary threshold for migrant workers and increasing the health surcharge. The Daily Express understands Home Office ministers have already floated both proposals but are frustrated at the resistance from the Treasury.

More info Visa and immigration applicants are currently charged £624 a year for using the health service. Raising that to £2,000 would be a “fairer” reflection of the costs, a source said. The minimum a skilled worker must earn to secure a visa in the UK is £26,200. But ministers believe that allows almost everyone who applies to qualify because it is set too low. The New Conservatives have called for it to be raised to £38,000. But the Treasury is said to fear that such measures will hit economic forecasts drawn up by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. Asked at the launch event for the migration report about tensions between the Home Office and the Treasury, Conservative MP James Daly said: “The Chancellor is a very reasonable man. “His stewardship of the economy is clearly taking us in the right direction. He is also a realistic man and he wants to respond to the needs of constituents around the country. There is always a balance to be had between what the Treasury desires and what other departments desire. But this is to such an extent now that I’m sure the Chancellor takes a very positive view of what we are saying.” Trending Ms Braverman was asked in the Commons about the possibility of raising the skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 a year. She said “net migration is too high” and that overall numbers needed to be reduced. We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review,” Ms Braverman added. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said the debate was “not just about GDP” but also includes “rapid social cultural change”, which needs to be “taken in the round”. He dismissed suggestions that universities will go bust as a result of the group’s recommendations that the rules around student visas are tightened up. “It’s not the job of government to prop up private institutions,” he said. Sunak launches new Illegal Migration Bill Mr Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. He called for the Government to go “further” but denied suggestions that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. The group pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration. Mr Hunt said the Prime Minister had been “incredibly brave” with his tough new Illegal Migration Bill that will allow migrants arriving illegally to be swiftly deported. He added: “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said that “huge volume” of migration to towns and cities in the last decade “changes the culture very significantly”. “It’s very difficult for local cultures, local communities, local societies to keep up with that change. It’s the pace of change that people find difficult as well as the change itself.” Ms Cates said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. SHE SAID THAT WITHOUT REFORMS “WE’RE NOT GOING TO STOP THE ADDICTION TO CHEAP LABOUR”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” A Treasury source said it was “not aware” of any issue relating to migration reforms that the Treasury or Chancellor is “blocking.” Who are the new conservatives? The New Conservatives launched in May with a mission to help the party reflect the interests of red wall voters that backed the party for the first time. As well as migration, the group wants to focus on cuts to the army, the rise of the “woke” agenda and tax freezes that have left people worse off. Made up of around 25 MPs from the last two general election intakes, members say their philosophy can be summed up in the phrase “common sense for the common good”. It adds: “We share the patriotic, kind, no-nonsense values of the British people, and for policies that will make us a stronger, safer and more united country.” Devizes MP Danny Kruger and Miriam Cates, who represents Penistone and Stocksbridge, founded the group. MPs on the right of the party from across the north and Midlands have signed up, including Stoke-on-Trent North’s Jonathan Gullis, James Daly, who represents Bury North, the most marginal constituency in the country, and Peterborough’s Paul Bristow, a close ally of Boris Johnson. Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson was expected to speak at yesterday's (MON) migration event but journalists were told he had “a terrible sick bug” and was at home recovering. MPs on the group have faced accusations they are undermining Rishi Sunak by setting out their own policy manifesto. But they all insisted they were loyal to the Prime Minister and were simply sharing ideas about how to resolve the seemingly impossible problem of rising migration.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1787186/suella-braverman-jeremy-hunt-migrants-tory-split-uk-economy,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1787186/suella-braverman-jeremy-hunt-migrants-tory-split-uk-economy

Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said Mr Sunak had 'fundamentally failed to get a grip' on the migrant crisis in the English Channel, despite a pledge to put a stop to small boats crossing from France. Mr Sunak entered 10 Downing Street on October 25. The Conservative Party leader, in a speech in January, made stopping the boats one of his top five priorities ahead of next year's likely general election. According to Ministry of Defence figures, more than 7,600 people, thought to have been asylum seekers, arrived in Britain in small boats between October 25 and December 31. More than 25,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel since Rishi Sunak moved into 10 Downing Street according to figures compiled by the Labour Party Some 144 people arrived in the UK from small boats on Friday, the Home Office has confirmed Home Office figures up to Friday suggest that almost 17,500 people have arrived via the same route in 2023. It is thought the 25,000 arrivals mark since Mr Sunak's premiership started was topped on Friday when the Home Office recorded that 144 people arrived in three boats. Over the past 12 months, French authorities have been able to stop less than half of those boats seeking to cross the Channel. Mr Kinnock said: 'The Conservatives have allowed criminal smuggling gangs to take hold on Britain's borders and Tory incompetence is risking our national security, putting lives at risk, and pounding the public purse for millions every day. 'Rishi Sunak has fundamentally failed to get a grip and crossings are rocketing on his watch. 'It's time for a different approach. The Prime Minister must now back Labour's plan to stop the dangerous Channel crossings by going after the criminal gangs, by securing a returns deal with Europe, and by clearing the asylum backlog which is costing the taxpayer £6 million a day.' HOME SECRETARY SUELLA BRAVERMAN SAID IN DECEMBER THAT ABOUT 40,000 MIGRANTS WERE BEING HOUSED IN HOTELS, WITH THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATING THAT ACCOMMODATING REFUGEES COSTS BRITISH TAXPAYERS BETWEEN £5 MILLION AND £6 MILLION PER DAY. Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party said only 3,000 people are being removed from the UK each year following failed asylum bids. Citing Home Office figures, Labour said only 16 per cent of asylum seekers who arrived by small boat between 2018 and March 2023 have had their asylum cases decided. The UK Government has applied a number of measures to make it less appealing to come to Britain via unauthorised routes. Ministers are looking to move migrants out of hotels and into accommodation on barges and former military sites. The Illegal Migration Act also allows for those arriving via small boats to be sent back to their country of origin or deported to Rwanda in east Africa. However, flights destined for Kigali have yet to take off, with the policy currently awaiting an appeal decision in the courts. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The unacceptable number of people risking their lives by making these dangerous crossings is placing an unprecedented strain on our asylum system. 'Our priority is to stop the boats, and our small boats operational command is working alongside our French partners and other agencies to disrupt the people smugglers. 'The Government is going even further through our Illegal Migration Act which will mean that people arriving in the UK illegally are detained and promptly removed to their country of origin or a safe third country.' A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'Sir Keir Starmer and his fellow lefty lawyers oppose any and every practical measure to stop the boats. 'A vote for Labour would be a vote for more boats, more hotels and more pressure on public services. 'Only the Conservatives have made stopping the boats a priority - our tough but fair approach means that if someone enters the UK illegally they will be detained immediately and removed to a safe country within weeks.' Labour said its plan to stop the boats would involve a cross-border police unit tasked with going after criminal smuggling gangs. It said the new unit would crack down on trafficking, while millions of pounds of new investment would be ploughed into the National Crime Agency to address the migrant issue. Officers would be based in the UK and throughout Europe to tackle the gangs across the continent, in collaboration with international allies and Europol, Labour officials said.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12425655/More-25-000-asylum-seekers-arrived-Britain-crossing-Channel-small-boats-Rishi-Sunak-Prime-Minister.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12425655/More-25-000-asylum-seekers-arrived-Britain-crossing-Channel-small-boats-Rishi-Sunak-Prime-Minister.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Mr Jenrick made the comments after a difficult week for the Government trying to control migration coming into the UK. Mr Jenrick also refused to say how many people had been removed from the UK under a deal with Albania, which targets people who have arrived in the country illegally from Albania. MR JENRICK SAID HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAD BEEN REMOVED BUT THAT OTHERS HAD ABSCONDED OR WERE STILL BEING HOUSED IN HOTELS. He told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that it was “early days” of the deal and that deportations had been held up by “spurious last-minute claims”. The deal with Albania, which has been praised by Rishi Sunak, came after figures showed more than a third of people who arrived on small boats were from Albania.

The latest figure is nearly double that of 2018, just five years ago. Mr Jenrick criticised the use of targets after a reference was made to a pledge made by former prime minister David Cameron to get migration down to the tens of thousands.

According to internal Government projections, the cost of this plan cost an eye-watering £6bn over two years. Chief policy analyst at the Refugee Council, Jon Featonby, said: “The Home Office is clearly aware that so-called deterrence measures simply don't work, and it is preparing to detain thousands of desperate people who will end up on our shores in search of protection.”",https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1777328/Robert-Jenrick-immigration-riddled-with-abuse,http://web.archive.org/web/20241213161138/https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1777328/Robert-Jenrick-immigration-riddled-with-abuse

The food is very good and there is plenty to do. We have a gym and there are English classes twice a week,’ Anas Mohammed told Mail Online. ‘The staff are very helpful and friendly. My only complaint is that the bedrooms are small and will be cramped when they are full.’ Anas revealed he had initially refused to leave a Hampshire hotel where he had been living after being told he would be moved to the giant barge moored in Portland Harbour while his asylum application is processed. But after being warned by the Home Office he would lose all support unless he moved and put his application to live permanently in the UK in jeopardy he decided to transfer to the barge. A person walks up the gangway of the Bibby Stockholm immigration barge today which is docked at Portland Port Police officers look out over the Bibby Stockholm immigration barge The 23-year-old said:’ I was at the Apollo hotel in Basingstoke. I had been there for six months since applying for asylum. ‘There were six of us that received letters telling us unless we had to move or we would lose support. ‘I decided to move. The other five did not come with me. I want my asylum application to go through and did not want to do anything that might hold it up. ‘I have only been on board 24 hours and it is ok. I am in a bedroom on my own, but it is very small. There is no one else in the room, so it is okay for now. His view of life on board the barge chimes with some of the other 15 asylum seekers who have differing opinions after taking up residence. While one has compared it to the former US maximum-security prison Alcatraz others have praised the facilities and food. Photos taken on board the barge showed the variety of breakfast choices on offer, including cereals, eggs, pancakes and yoghurts. An Algerian asylum seeker told The Sun he was enjoying his time on the barge while an Afghan compared the accommodation to a prison. ‘It’s like a prison here – the sound of locks and security checks makes it feel like I’m entering Alcatraz,’ the Afghan national told the BBC. One man filmed the breakfast on offer, which included a selection of cereals, eggs, cheese, jam and butter. Breakfast choices include eggs, pancakes, bread and yoghurts and pictures show bottles of Ribena and Heinz tomato ketchup, Kellogg's Rice Krispies and Cornflakes Other new clips shared from inside showed the rooms, which feature a twin bunk beds, a desk, an en-suite, heating, windows and wardrobe space One man described both the breakfast and the beds as 'good' after his first day Those onboard the Bibby Stockholm have shared the first clips of the barge in operation Strict security measures are in place aboard the barge with the asylum seekers who leave for a trip into Weymouth being told to scan everything they are carrying before leaving. With an hourly shuttle service from Portland Harbour six of the asylum seekers today took advantage of the free service to go into Weymouth town centre which was packed with holidaymakers. Anas said he wanted to look round the town but with an allowance of £9 a week he did not have any money to spend. For many of the migrants it was their first taste of the British seaside as they wandered past ice cream vans and families in beachwear. Some of the asylum seekers stood out among the crowds due to their clothing. While most people were in shorts and summer wear in 70degree temperatures they were dressed in winter clothing and warm jackets. Anas said he arrived in the UK six months ago on a tourist visa having flown from Jordan where his family fled during the Syrian civil war. As soon as he arrived in the UK he applied for asylum and has been waiting to hear if he is successful. He had previously lived in the UK and spent a term at Bradford University on a language course. He said he has trained as civil engineer and speaks in near perfect English. Anas said he was originally from the town of Daraa where the Syrian uprising first began in 2011. It later became the focus of intense fighting with Isis leading to tens of thousands fleeing across the border to Jordan. He said his family still live in Jordan and he has no other relatives in the UK.

I don’t think we should be treated like animals as we are human beings. ‘The people here have accepted me and I am very grateful for that. I would like to work and have trained as a civil engineer.’ Anas said he has been pleasantly surprised by conditions on the Bibby Stockholm. He said the food was ‘very good’ with his last meal consisting of noodles accompanied by a salad. ‘There is so much food, it is very good and everyone seems happy with it. The staff are very nice and you are made to feel welcome. Most of the migrants spend their time in a lounge area on the barge with others making trips into Weymouth town centre. A coach shuttle service takes them on the eight-mile trip from the harbour to the town centre. Anas said he only has spending money of £9 a week so he is limited in what he can buy. A mobile phone is supplied to each of the asylum seekers by the Home Office. A bus departs Portland Port in Dorset where the Bibby Stockholm is moored A coach arrives at the front gates as the Bibby Stockholm welcomes its first asylum seekers in Portland, Dorset Campaigners attempted to give goodie bags containing flowers, shampoo and maps of Portland to the asylum seekers Campaigners brought bunches of flowers and welcome packs containing toiletries and other useful items to give them to asylum seekers arriving on the barge Anas declined to have his photograph taken as he said he feared relatives still in Syria might be subject to retribution. While living in Jordan he was unable to obtain permanent residency and so decided to try and get asylum in the UK. ‘I was here for a semester at Bradford University, and I enjoyed my time. The people were so friendly, and I always wanted to come back.’ Only about 15 asylum seekers are on the barge with hundreds more expected up to a capacity of 500. The barge was originally intended to house 222 people but has been expanded to 500 on orders of the Home Office. IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK HAS SAID THE ASYLUM SEEKERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO HAVE AN ‘A LA CARTE’ CHOICE OF ACCOMMODATION.

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change.

'The Scottish Government wants to make it easier for people, including those seeking to reconnect with family roots, to gain citizenship and contribute to our economy, society and public services like the NHS. 'And when we re-join the EU as an independent country, Scottish citizens will be able to enjoy all the benefits of EU citizenship too.' The Scottish Government's latest independence paper claimed, even if an independent Scotland signed up to the EU, Scots would still maintain freedom of movement across the rest of the UK and Ireland due to membership of the Common Travel Area. It also stated Scotland would not have to fully become part of the EU's Schengen zone, which abolishes passport and other types of border controls between the bloc's member states. 'As a result of the CTA arrangements, there would be no new passport or immigration checks at any of an independent Scotland's land, sea or air border points with the UK and Ireland, and British, Irish and Scottish citizens would have the right to move freely within the CTA,' the paper said. 'Scottish citizens would also be able to take full advantage of their rights as EU citizens, just as citizens of Ireland do. 'The logic for there being special arrangements in EU law between Ireland and the UK would apply equally to an independent Scotland. 'The goal of the European project is to remove borders across the EU, not to introduce them where they do not currently exist.' The document said the Scottish Government's 'priority' in its migration policy was to 'encourage people to live and work permanently in Scotland'. 'We would want to remove disincentives to people choosing to settle here and make a commitment to our communities and economy,' the paper added, as it oulined plans to make citizenship fees cheaper than the current UK equivalent. The document set out four ways that people would become a Scottish citizen after independence. These are automatic entitlement on the day of independence; by birth after independence; by registering as a Scottish citizen; or by applying to become a Scottish citizen. Scottish citizenship would be open to those living in Scotland, those born in Scotland, those who have a parent who was a British citizen born in Scotland, or those who had previously lived in Scitland for at least ten years, or five years as a child. Donald Cameron, a Scottish Conservative MSP, accused the SNP of 'retreating to their independence comfort blanket' as they face a series of scandals. 'This latest self-indulgent paper touting independence is not just a blatant misuse of public money and resources by the SNP, it demonstrates how out of touch they are with the public,' he said. 'It's a sign of Humza Yousaf's weakness that he is once again obsessing on breaking up the UK – because it's the only issue his feuding party can agree on. 'Rather than wasting taxpayers' money and civil servants' time on pushing a divisive, party political agenda, a strong leader would be concentrating on the issues that matter to Scots – unacceptable NHS waiting times and the cost-of-living crisis. 'As for tackling population decline, the SNP's policy of making Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK is an active disincentive to people settling here.' Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said the paper was 'more therapy for Humza Yousaf and the nationalist movement than a serious attempt to persuade people to support their cause'. 'Even if it is just for a few hours, it must be a great relief to be distracted from broken ferries, ever longer waiting lists and a social care backlog that mushrooms,' he added. The anti-independence Scotland In Union campaign said: 'Taxpayers will find it galling that the SNP is forcing them to bankroll another fantasy document. 'There are so many other matters the Scottish Government should be focusing on.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12344143/SNPs-fantasy-plan-open-independent-Scotlands-borders-migrants-Humza-Yousaf-claims-WONT-need-passports-England.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12344143/SNPs-fantasy-plan-open-independent-Scotlands-borders-migrants-Humza-Yousaf-claims-WONT-need-passports-England.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Damning stats out today showed staggering numbers of people came to Britain in the last year - but few criminals were booted out. 4 A boat carrying 50 migrants drifted into English waters earlier today Credit: Getty Just 4,193 wrong-uns were sent back home - an increase on the year before but still thousands fewer than before the pandemic. Most of them (72 per cent) were foreign national offenders who had committed horrific crimes. The asylum backlog in the UK has now hit a record high too - giving the PM a fresh headache as he battles to stop the boats and push down the number of legacy cases. It came as another 345 migrants made their way to the UK yesterday - making the last fortnight the worst this year. The huge data dump from the Home Office also revealed: A whopping 78,000 asylum applications were made in the last year - the highest number in TWO decades Half a million people were offered a visa after fleeing from Ukraine, Hong Kong, or were resettling with family 125million people arrived in the UK to visit, live or work last year - almost twice as many as the year before where travel had been hit by Covid 3.2million visas were granted last year - 58 per cent higher than the year before A staggering 900,000 of those were visitor visas - with work visas up by two thirds to 530,000 and study visas up a third to 650,000 Family visas also doubled to 75,000 as yet more partners came to join their other halves in the UK The cost of the UK's asylum system has almost doubled in just a year - as so many more people have come here The staggering numbers come despite the Government repeatedly promising to lower the number of people coming to the UK. Rishi Sunak has repeatedly refused to commit to slashing net migration to the tens of thousands (under 100,000) - a promise made in the Tory manifesto. But now he is only promising to cut it to below the number he inherited when he got into No10 last November. Critics say that increasing numbers of people coming to the UK is only piling more pressure in Britain's housing system, NHS and other services. Alp Mehmet, Chairman of Migration Watch UK hit out at the latest stark stats, saying: ""These are damning figures and a stark reminder of the scale of the government’s failure to control, let alone reduce, immigration.” ""Indeed their policies have driven much of the uncontrolled increase. No doubt the public will bear this lamentable performance in mind when it comes to casting their vote at the next election."" Stephen Kinnock, Labour's shadow immigration minister, added: ""These new statistics set out in stark terms the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system. ""The asylum backlog has reached a new record high, with 175,000 people now waiting for decisions. ""WITH THIS LEVEL OF MISMANAGEMENT, THERE IS VERY LITTLE PROSPECT OF REDUCING THE EYE-WATERINGLY HIGH BILL FOR HOTEL ROOMS FOR ALL THOSE LEFT IN LIMBO, CURRENTLY COSTING THE BRITISH TAXPAYER £6 MILLION A DAY."" Cost of crisis The total cost of the asylum has now reached £3.97bn a year - up from £2.12 billion in 2021/22. In stark contrast, in 2012/13, the total was just £500 million. Millions of pounds every day is spent putting up asylum seekers in hotels while they wait for their cases to be decided. And the number of people coming to the UK in small boats has continued to grow. Backlog up The backlog of people waiting for a decision on whether they can stay in the UK has reached a new record high, the Home Office said today. 175,000 people were waiting for their initial decision - up 44 per cent from the year before. 4 Border Force picking up more arrivals earlier today Credit: Chris Eades 4 Another 341 people arrived in the UK on small boats yesterday (Wednesday) Credit: Getty It's the highest figure since 2010 when the current records began. The PM has vowed to eradicate the legacy backlog by the end of the year - the group of 90,000 people who have been waiting the longest for decisions. But the stats also showed that a huge seven in ten people were having their asylum applications rubber-stamped - up from around 30 per cent in previous years. Visas increased More skilled worker visas were issued in the last 12 months in a bid to fill gaps in the UK's economy. They were up by a third - with half a million people arriving to work in the last year. Study visas were also up by a third to 627,000 as people flocked here to study post-pandemic. The news comes after plans to slash the number of dependent visas who can come to the UK. Tory MP Jonathan Gullis, said: ""A lot of people will rightly be concerned to see another huge rise in skilled worker visas particularly as the thresholds in education have been reduced, so we will probably be continuing to rely on cheap foreign labour into the future, whenever there is a shortage. ""We should be taking big businesses head on and forcing them to upskill young people and adults looking to retrain to develop our own workforce within the UK."" A Home Office spokesperson said of the news out today: “The government’s focus is clear – we must stop the boats and prevent the unacceptable number of people risking their lives by making these dangerous and illegal crossings, which continue to place an unprecedented strain on our asylum system. “We’ve transformed our immigration system to work in our best interests by encouraging the best and brightest to come to the UK, to support the growth of the economy and boost prosperity, and we remain absolutely committed to reducing levels of immigration into this country.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/23640776/migrant-crisis-fresh-pressure-rishi-sunak-backlog-criminals/,http://web.archive.org/web/20240115002302/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/23640776/migrant-crisis-fresh-pressure-rishi-sunak-backlog-criminals/

A Freedom of Information request revealed the cost of works at Manston in Kent, where all asylum seekers arriving on small boats are detained for initial processing. The facility, which became unlawfully overcrowded and saw a diphtheria outbreak last autumn, previously had murals of Disney characters including Anna from Frozen on the walls of its children and families unit. Following a visit in February, the prisons watchdog praised the area for being “decorated in bright cheerful colours”. But it emerged last month that the murals had been painted over by the Home Office, along with similar cartoons of Mickey Mouse and other characters at the separate Kent Intake Unit. In response to a Freedom of Information request by a member of the public, the Home Office said the “redecoration” of reception areas at Manston had cost £1,549.52. IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK PREVIOUSLY TOLD MPS THAT THERE “WAS NO FINANCIAL COST TO PAINT OVER THE MURALS IN THE KENT INTAKE UNIT”. He claimed he ordered the move because they were not “age-appropriate”, after being accused of losing “sight of humanity” with his intervention. “The cohort of unaccompanied children who passed through [the Kent Intake Unit] last year were largely teenagers and we didn’t feel the site was age-appropriate, but it does contain a range of support for children and infants,” Mr Jenrick told the House of Commons last month. Murals, photographed by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, were painted over on the immigration minister’s orders at the Kent Intake Unit (HM Inspectorate of Prisons) “Nothing about the decoration of sites changes the fundamentals that if someone comes to the UK we will treat them with decency and compassion at all times.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said that painting over cartoons would not “deter” small boats, and accused the minister of trampling over “common decency towards vulnerable children”. The Freedom From Torture charity accused the government of “losing sight of its humanity”, while Labour MP Stella Creasy compared the minister to a “cartoon villain”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-painting-children-cartoons-detention-b2389497.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230810154222/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-painting-children-cartoons-detention-b2389497.html

The Labour MP added: “We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. “I’m confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.” The Bibby Stockholm in Portland Port, Dorset, is the first barge the Government has procured to house asylum seekers while their claims are processed.

The overwhelming majority are hard-working, honest and decent – and want to do the best by their clients. But a small number are none of these things. The lawyers who coached would-be illegal immigrants to concoct fictional back-stories to secure asylum claims are putting a dagger through the heart of our justice system. They shame the profession to which I have devoted much of my life. A fair, honest and impartial legal system is the basis of our democracy. These revelations will shake people's faith in it. While all of us find the actions of career criminals deplorable, it is more shocking to discover that those who we expect to uphold the law are instead helping to perpetrate a fraud upon us all. I am appalled that solicitors and so-called 'legal advisers' should have behaved in such a way. To make matters worse, the cynical practices uncovered by the Mail appear to be widespread.

Encouraging illegal immigrants to get married to a British resident may be an old ruse, but it's still as effective. Handing out anti-depressants to use as 'evidence' of trauma is less well-known, but equally vile. By misleading the court, as these advisers proposed doing, not only are they in breach of their professional duties, but many would be committing criminal offences: namely, perverting the course of public justice, which usually – and rightly – results in an immediate custodial sentence.

Their actions make it harder for those most in need to have their claims fairly heard. It is almost beyond my comprehension that advisers working for firms governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority could instruct applicants on how to make up stories. For the firms that employ these advisors, ignorance should be no defence. The senior solicitors might not themselves have urged claimants to lie, but it is their responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen. There should have been safeguards, such as regular audits, to make sure employees were behaving ethically and lawfully. Their failure should carry severe consequences. One of the great popular myths about the legal profession is the idea that we lawyers treat the truth as something flexible. The question I'm always asked in a black cab is: 'How can you defend a murderer when you know he's guilty?' And the answer is: 'I can't defend him if he tells me he did it. Legally and ethically, it's forbidden.' Every law student learns legal ethics at the very start of their training. It's impossible to gain any qualifications without understanding them. In fact, one of my favourite dictums – and one that I pass on to young people coming into the profession – is: 'Never do anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the Daily Mail.' That's a great rule of thumb to help concentrate the mind on where the grey areas of ethics start. But the alleged behaviour of these lawyers in flouting immigration rules is not in any grey area. If true, it's as bad as any criminal I've prosecuted. If these allegations are proven, these men must be struck off, imprisoned and disgraced.

The Prime Minister ruled out more borrowing and tax rises as ways to fund the £2billion package. Mr Sunak said: “What we have done are two things to find this money. THE FIRST IS WE’RE GOING TO INCREASE THE CHARGES THAT WE HAVE FOR MIGRANTS WHO ARE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN THEY APPLY FOR VISAS. “And indeed, something called the immigration health surcharge which is the levy that they pay to access the NHS. So all of those fees are going to go up and that will raise over a billion pounds.” The charity Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, claimed that the Government was treating people born outside the UK as “cash cows”. Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz, its public affairs manager, said raising “already eye-wateringly high” visa fees risks seeing people fall deeper into poverty and insecurity. But Mr Sunak said choices had to be made over funding public sector pay rises. He added: “I’m not shying away from that, because I think that’s the right thing to do.” Around half of the cost will be met by a rise of up to 20 per cent in visa fees and increasing the immigration health surcharge from £624 to £1,035. Whitehall departments will also have to “reprioritise” resources to help pay the rest of the bill. Mr Sunak insisted that was “not about cuts” but was “just about focusing on public sector workers’ pay rather than other things”. He added: “And I’m really pleased that the teaching unions specifically have said that this pay offer is properly funded.” The classroom unions said they would urge members to accept the offer, which would bring to an end months of strike action. In a joint statement the ASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU said: “A 6½ percent increase for teachers and school leaders recognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession.” They said the offer was “properly funded” and schools will receive extra cash for it. Union chiefs who will put the offer to members said: “This deal will allow teachers and school leaders to call off strike action and resume normal relations with Government.” But doctors’ leaders at the BMA said they feel they had “no option but to take industrial action” after years of below-inflation pay awards. Junior doctors, who yesterday began their longest walkout yet in England, will receive rises of six percent plus a £1,250 bonus.

More info Hospital consultants, due to strike in England next week, will be given six per cent too. Some doctors who are training will receive more than 10 percent. Mr Sunak insisted the awards will not be reviewed, even if some staff take further industrial action. He said: “There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year’s settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.” He urged consultants and junior doctors to accept the pay offer and warned strikes made it “far harder” for care backlogs to be cleared. The PM said the awards were based on recommendations from independent pay review bodies “which we have accepted in full”. He added: “I would urge them to accept this offer from the independent bodies. And that way we can all work collectively together to bring the backlogs down. I know that that’s what the vast majority of them want to see happen. “That’s what I want to see happen and I’m prepared to work with them to do that.” Professor Phil Banfield, the BMA’s chairman of council, called the offer “yet another pay cut in real terms and [it] serves only to increase the losses faced by doctors after more than a decade’s worth of sub-inflation pay awards.” Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the rise was fair: “It reflects the hugely important work that doctors do, and it’s an opportunity now for the NHS to move forward.” He denied the Government would make department cuts to fund the increases, saying the proposed immigration surcharge rise “better reflects the increased costs of providing NHS cover to those who come to the UK” and a “fair and reasonable approach”. He said the pay offer was final but added “My door is open to discuss other issues” with the BMA including working conditions in the NHS. Tory MP Steve Brine, the chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, paid credit to teaching unions “for recognising reality”.

But the latest damning landmark for the PM was reached on Friday when 144 more arrived in small boats. It comes after legionella forced migrants to be evacuated from the Bibby Stockholm barge and six people drowned when a small boat capsized in the Channel. Ministers are appealing a Court of Appeal decision blocking their plan to send migrants to Rwanda, which they hope will act as a deterrent to crossings.

Then a solicitor, he travelled to the country on a 2008 trip for Tory MPs and party members, including future home secretary Suella Braverman. Mr Jenrick, who has been criticised for allegedly ordering staff to paint over cheerful paintings at an asylum unit for children, was elected to parliament six years later and now has a leading role implementing the Rwanda migration deal. After it was ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal last week, Mr Jenrick fiercely defended the policy, telling MPs it was “categorically untrue” that asylum seekers were at risk in the country. The court heard that Rwandan police shot at least 12 refugees dead during a 2018 protest over food shortages, and that more recently authorities had turned away Afghan and Syrian asylum seekers. The Court of Appeal judgment called Rwanda “a one-party state which reacts unfavourably to dissent”, but Mr Jenrick told parliament he had travelled there himself and added: “It is a country that is safe and where we have a good working relationship. “As soon as we have the ability to do so through the courts, we will get those flights off to Rwanda.” His two-week visit in 2008 was part of Project Umubano, which was described on its website as “the Conservative Party’s social action project in Rwanda and Sierra Leone” and ran from 2007 to 2017. Other future and current MPs involved included Jeremy Hunt, Tobias Ellwood, Desmond Swayne, Rob Halfon, Damian Hinds, Mark Pawsey, Maggie Throup, Wendy Morton and Pauline Latham. President Kagame is understood to have attended some events and told a local newspaper Project Umubano was “meaningful and will help people back in the UK understand Rwanda better”. It was led by international development minister Andrew Mitchell, who told The Independent: “Mr Jenrick used his legal skills to great effect as part of the Conservative Party’s social action partnership, Project Umubano, working with lawyers in Rwanda.” The project focused on five areas, with the justice pillar seeing 12 lawyers and volunteers including Ms Braverman and Mr Jenrick run workshops in the Rwandan government’s Ministry of Justice and at a university. Rwandan president Paul Kagame with Conservative MP Andrew Mitchel during a celebration for the 10th anniversary of Project Umubano, Kigali, 11 August 2017 (Paul Kagame/CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) An article written by Mr Mitchell at the time said they would cover the “English legal system and international treaties”. Steve Smith MBE, chief executive of refugee charity Care4Calais, said that both the immigration minister and home secretary’s previous trips to Rwanda “raise serious questions about the government’s decision to continue pursuing their brutal, immoral and expensive policy”. “The Court of Appeal ruling was clear - Rwanda is not a safe country to remove refugees to,” he added. “Yet Ms Braverman and Mr Jenrick continue to assert that it is, offering no evidence other than the Rwandan government’s hollow assurances. People will rightly be wondering why they continue to pursue this policy, and why our government continues to squander millions of pounds of public money when it has been ruled unlawful.” Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesperson, said: “Ministers like Robert Jennrick should be ashamed to own this unworkable, ineffective and expensive policy. What’s worst is his boss Suella Braverman seems intent on taking the Home Office to the brink trying to follow through with it.” The Independent could not find any public record of Mr Jenrick discussing the trip, but Ms Braverman co-wrote an article under her maiden name Suella Fernandes in December 2008. IT SAID VOLUNTEER LAWYERS AIMED TO “REGENERATE RWANDA’S LEGAL SYSTEM” FOLLOWING THE 1994 GENOCIDE, BY WORKING WITH THE KAGAME GOVERNMENT’S MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AND A STATE-FUNDED LAW SCHOOL. UK government's Rwanda asylum plan is unlawful, says Court of Appeal The article suggested that Rwanda did not have a “properly functioning legal system”, and said there was an “almost total absence of what we as UK lawyers often take for granted”. A source close to Mr Jenrick said: “The immigration minister visited Rwanda on a volunteering trip as a private citizen before he became an MP, helping to train lawyers at a Rwandan university. “He would highly recommend other young people take opportunities to see the world and make a contribution whenever they can.” His role in Project Umubano is not believed to have fallen under any disclosure requirement under the ministerial code. Ms Braverman was a barrister and Conservative Party election candidate at the time of her involvement, and went on to co-found and direct a charity delivering training to Rwandan government lawyers. She did not formally disclose five years of work with the Africa Justice Foundation to the Home Office but Rishi Sunak refused to trigger an inquiry after The Independent revealed the link in May. Ms Braverman resigned from her post as director weeks before being elected as an MP, by which time Rwandan media reported that 19 alumni were serving in government institutions including the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister and Ministry of Justice. A spokesperson for the home secretary previously said she had not disclosed her involvement in the Africa Justice Foundation because it was not necessary, and that she did not make any submissions to colleagues on the country’s suitability for an asylum deal.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rwanda-deal-robert-jenrick-braverman-b2368368.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240710002159/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rwanda-deal-robert-jenrick-braverman-b2368368.html

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""BECAUSE OF THE COMPLETE AND UTTER CHAOS AND SHAMBLES OF THE TORY ASYLUM CRISIS, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE IN A VERY SHORT-TERM PERIOD TO USE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS THERE, INCLUDING THE BARGES AND THE HOTELS."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

Following a small boat incident off the coast of Dungeness in Kent earlier today an RNLI lifeboat safely led assure the migrants. It comes after figures from the Ministry of Defence showed more than 7,600 people, thought to be asylum seekers, arrived in Britain in small boats between October 25 and December 31. Home Office figures up to Friday suggest that almost 17,500 people have arrived via the same route in 2023. During a visit to a nursery in North Yorkshire, Mr Sunak stated that stopping the boats was one of his top five priorities ahead of next year's likely general election. A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dungeness, Kent Following a small boat incident in the Channel, an RNLI lifeboat brought in the migrants It is thought the 25,000 arrivals mark since Mr Sunak's premiership started was topped on Friday when the Home Office recorded that 144 people arrived in three boats. Over the past 12 months, French authorities have been able to stop less than half of those boats seeking to cross the Channel. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said Mr Sunak had 'fundamentally failed to get a grip' on the migrant crisis in the English Channel, despite a pledge to put a stop to small boats crossing from France. 'The Conservatives have allowed criminal smuggling gangs to take hold on Britain's borders and Tory incompetence is risking our national security, putting lives at risk, and pounding the public purse for millions every day,' he said.

Speaking to the broadcasters earlier today, the Prime Minister said: ' One of my five priorities is to stop the boats. The current system is both unsustainable and is completely unfair, but particularly unfair on British taxpayers who are forking out millions of pounds to house illegal migrants in hotels and local communities. 'That's not right. We've got to put a stop to that. And we're working on it. 'It's not an easy problem to fix. I never said we would be able to solve it overnight. It will take time and we have to attack it from lots of different ways. But I am pleased that the number of illegal migrants crossing this year is down for the first time in some years.

There is not one simple solution and it can't be solved overnight and I wouldn't be being straight with people if I said that was possible.' During the same visit, Mr Sunak also defended plans to house migrants on an RAF base in Lincolnshire that has historic links to the Second World War Dambusters raid. Asked about the risk that moving asylum seekers into RAF Scampton poses to a multimillion-pound investment, he told regional broadcasters: 'Of course the Home Office and other authorities are in dialogue with all local partners to work through all the outstanding issues and questions.'

It has been opposed by other parties but I think it is the right thing to do, and we are taking action to reduce, as I say, the amount that taxpayers are spending on housing illegal migrants in hotels. 'It is millions of pounds a day - that is not right, it is not fair.' This comes after it was alleged that the Home Office is spending more than £300million on new detention centres for Channel migrants. The Home Office is seeking contractors to operate three new immigration removal centres (IRCs) designed to hold 1,000 people in total. The contracts – valued at £306million – will run for four years and 'possibly for up to a further two years', official documents say, indicating ministers expect the Channel crisis could continue until the end of the decade. A week earlier leaked documents revealed that Brussels has ruled out a deal which would allow Channel migrants to be sent back to France. Official records indicate the refusal came from one of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen's most trusted aides.

They are also ordered not to be sceptical when quizzing asylum seekers – including those who have come from safe countries.

Home Office staff are also 'forbidden' from asking questions about 'sexual preferences or activity' in cases where migrants claim to be fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation. Earlier today it was revealed that thousands of migrants have been slaughtered by Saudi border guards this year after they opened fire on them 'like rain' as they tried to cross through Yemen into the Gulf kingdom, a major report has found. The Human Rights Watch report, released Monday, said some migrants, many of them from Ethiopia, were attacked at close range while others were fired on by mortar projectiles. Many of the migrants reportedly had their legs severed and fingers shot off as their bodies were strewn across the trail. The allegations, described as 'unfounded' by a Saudi government source, point to a significant escalation of abuses along the perilous 'Eastern Route' from the Horn of Africa to Saudi Arabia, where hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians live and work.

The rule of law depends upon lawyers representing their clients robustly and to the best of their ability. Lawyers are entitled – indeed obliged – to find any credible legal angle that gets the best result for their client. But they are not allowed to lie. Nor are they allowed to encourage others to lie. That's why this hugely important investigation by the Mail is extremely shocking. The alleged behaviour this paper's reporters have uncovered is not only appalling and irresponsible, but potentially criminal. It shows why it has been so hard for the Government to remove people with no right to be here – and why we were right to change the law to curb spurious challenges to removal. We know that the majority of lawyers are professional practitioners, but we also know there are some lawyers who are ideologically opposed to illegal-migration controls. They have said so, proudly. 'I spent several years as a barrister defending the Home Office, often against spurious claims from migrants,' writes Home Secretary Suella Braverman (pictured) Sir Keir Starmer (pictured) has even argued that there is a 'racist undercurrent' which 'permeates all immigration law' They've gone to town in using domestic law, international law and other conventions to prevent the removal of small-boat entrants and even foreigners convicted of heinous crimes including murder and rape. And they've been cheered on by the Government's political opponents. Indeed, Sir Keir Starmer has even argued that there is a 'racist undercurrent' which 'permeates all immigration law'. To howls of protest, we have changed the law – through the Nationality and Borders Act and the new Illegal Migration Act – to close loopholes, stop people exploiting modern slavery laws, make it easier to remove foreign criminals and deprive those who come here illegally of any right to stay. AND THE LABOUR PARTY HAS TRIED TO BLOCK US AT EVERY TURN. The British people want us to stop the boats and remove foreign criminals. They're right and should feel no shame. Time and again the public have proven how generous they are to Syrians, Afghans, Hong Kongers, Ukrainians and others who need refuge. However, our local communities are being overwhelmed by migrants who paid people-smuggling gangsters to bring them here from safe countries such as France. Some 45,000 people arrived by small boats in the last year. The majority were adult males under the age of 40 and we are now spending more than £6million a day on hotels alone to house migrants in this country. Illegal migration makes us less safe, is unfair on taxpayers, supports organised crime, has led to thousands of people perishing needlessly at sea and disadvantaged the genuinely vulnerable who play by the rules. Nobody sane wants foreign rapists, paedophiles or murderers on our streets. Staff at solicitors’ firms readily agreed to help an undercover Mail reporter posing as an economic migrant get refugee status - despite being told he had no legitimate reason to stay in the UK after arriving on a small boat. VP Lingajothy (pictured) asked for £10,000 to invent a horrific back story to use in the asylum application Yet so-called progressives on the Left have utter contempt for public opinion and instead want to open our borders to any and everyone. I am shocked by what the Mail's brilliant journalists have uncovered, but I can't say I'm wholly surprised. I fear it may well be the tip of the iceberg. A good, honourable lawyer makes the most of the law. A dodgy lawyer will cheat and lie. That's why I am doing everything I can to work with our authorities to track down and punish any lawyers or firms found to be engaging in these kinds of practices. Either way, the law had to change. It contained too many loopholes for people to block or frustrate their removal. Now we have evidence that some lawyers would stop at nothing, including lying.

Last month in the House of Lords, Mr Clarke backed the “extraordinary” small boats law and has reconfirmed his position as the Illegal Migration Bill is set for its third reading on Monday afternoon. Everyone knows that it is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here. Ken Clark Writing in The Telegraph, Mr Clarke said while he has advocated the benefits that migrants bring to Britain, “doing nothing about illegal immigration is not an option”. He said: “Importantly, in all the debate about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, no one has advanced an alternative. “I have listened keenly for an idea of how else we might deal with the mounting problem of irregular migration, but answer has come there none.” The flagship legislation passed through the House of Commons but has met fierce opposition in the Lords. It aims to ensure those who arrive in the UK without permission will be detained and promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda. Mr Clarke said he is not making his comments out of “slavish loyalty” and he has not always been an admirer of the Government. But he lauded the Government’s approach to welcoming in Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong. He said: “We are not becoming a walled-in, closed country. That is a good British contribution to a tremendous problem for the whole of the Western World. “Everyone knows that (illegal migration) is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here.” A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, from a Border Force vessel, following a small boat incident in the Channel in May (Gareth Fulle/ PA) It comes as 1,070 migrants crossed the Channel in 13 boats on Friday and in seven boats on Saturday, according to Home Office figures. That takes the provisional total for the year so far to over 12,500 people. Home Secretary Suella Braverman has been fighting to get her central policy of forcibly removing unauthorised arrivals to Rwanda off the ground after it was blocked by appeal judges. The Government has lodged a bid to take its legal battle to the Supreme Court.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-12281671/Ken-Clarke-Doing-illegal-immigration-not-option.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-12281671/Ken-Clarke-Doing-illegal-immigration-not-option.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Jenrick also deflected questions on Sunday about how many people had been removed from the UK under a “gold standard” UK-Albanian deal, which targets people arriving illegally from Albania mainly by crossing the Channel. He said hundreds of people had been removed but that others were still being housed in hotels or had absconded. Jenrick told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday show it was still “early days” under the deal and that “spurious last minute claims” had held up deportations. The deal with the Albanian authorities had been lauded by Rishi Sunak as the prime minister came under pressure from the right of the Tory party after figures showed more than a third of people who arrived on small boats in the UK via the Channel in the first nine months of 2022 were from Albania. While Jenrick initially said thousands had been removed to Albania, he went on to qualify this by saying: “There are hundreds of Albanians who’ve arrived on small boats who have been placed on those flights as a result of the processes we put in place and the agreements that we’ve reached with Albania.” The government is under renewed pressure from its own backbenches after figures published last month showed net immigration to the UK had increased from 488,000 in 2021 to 606,000 in 2022. The figure for last year is nearly double the number in 2018. Jenrick told the BBC that net immigration was “far too high today”. But when asked about a pledge under David Cameron to limit immigration to “tens of thousands” of people a year, Jenrick said: “I don’t think that targets like that are particularly helpful because migration is an extremely challenging space where behaviours are constantly changing.” He said a lot of progress had been made on illegal immigration in a short period of time, with “really unique landmark deals” with France resulting in a “big increase” in the number of interceptions on the beaches. But Jenrick said the asylum system, which, according to him had a backlog of more than 150,000 cases, must be changed “fundamentally”. HE SAID THE ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL WOULD ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURE. The government’s asylum bill – which is supposed to change the law so that those who arrive in the UK by irregular means can be removed to a third country such as Rwanda – goes before the House of Lords this week. It is expected to face significant opposition from peers and could be amended or delayed until later in the year. Defending the government’s record during a round of broadcast interviews on Sunday, Jenrick said a lot of progress had been made on illegal immigration in a short period of time. But he told the BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “The asylum system is riddled with abuse, we have to be honest with ourselves.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guardian Headlines UK Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Westminster city council’s leader wrote to the home secretary, Suella Braverman, to express “deep concern” that about 40 refugees had been placed in the borough on Wednesday night “without appropriate accommodation or support available … and no prior communication with the local authority”. Jenrick said: “As I understand what happened here was that these migrants, who had themselves said that they were destitute, they had nowhere to stay, we had offered them a safe bed with board and lodgings in a good-quality hotel in central London. “Yes, some of them had to share with other people. These are single adult males: I don’t think that’s unreasonable,” he said, adding that the government wanted to reduce the cost to the taxpayer.

She praised this newspaper's investigation last month that revealed some solicitors were charging up to £10,000 to create fake asylum and human rights claims for illegal immigrants. Mrs Braverman said last night: 'The Mail has done a great public service with its investigation into crooked immigration lawyers.

I know our teams are working incredibly hard to root out those who game our asylum system and cheat the British public – this can't go on.' The taskforce has been secretly working for months but its existence was officially confirmed only today. A Home Office spokesman said the unit had already uncovered links between an immigration advice firm and 'one of the most wanted human traffickers'. Details of the case have been referred to the police, he added.

In future, it will widen its scope to investigate doctors, accountants and employers who conspire to aid illegal migrants. Those found guilty of fraud could face life imprisonment. The Professional Enablers Taskforce will train frontline immigration staff to identify and report 'suspect activity'. This could include, for example, patterns of similar claims being submitted for different migrants by the same firms. Evidence dossiers will be passed on to police or the National Crime Agency to launch prosecutions. In addition, there will be improved intelligence-sharing across a range of departments and quangos. Mrs Braverman will today chair a meeting with her Cabinet colleague Alex Chalk, the Solicitors Regulation Authority watchdog and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner to herald the new crackdown. Mrs Braverman will today chair a meeting with her Cabinet colleague Alex Chalk (pictured), the Solicitors Regulation Authority watchdog and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner to herald the new crackdown Mr Chalk, who is the Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, said: 'The accuracy and honesty of legal advice underpins the integrity of our world-leading legal system, so those who undermine it by encouraging deception must be held to account. 'This Government is committed to stopping the boats – that means breaking the business model of criminal gangs and holding to account unscrupulous lawyers who aid and abet them by abusing the legal system.' The Mail's investigation led to the SRA suspending three legal firms caught offering to lodge fake asylum applications. The lawyers who were the subject of this paper's expose are being investigated by the SRA over their allegedly unlawful activities. The police have not become involved at this stage. In one case, a legal adviser told an undercover reporter posing as an economic migrant that he could invent claims of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats. He promised he could get a doctor's report to back up the story and even produced anti-depressants to be given to the Home Office as 'evidence' of psychological trauma. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. He boasted of a success rate of more than 90 per cent with similar asylum cases. A third outlined the 'fine ingredients of an asylum case' he said he would use to make it appear that the reporter feared for his life in India. This could include anti-government political allegiances, a love affair with someone from the wrong caste or being gay. Two said they would falsely claim that the undercover reporter was a 'victim of human trafficking' who had been fleeced, betrayed and abandoned by people smugglers. MRS BRAVERMAN SAID LAST NIGHT: 'CROOKED IMMIGRATION LAWYERS MUST BE ROOTED OUT AND BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. While the majority of lawyers act with integrity, we know that some are lying to help illegal migrants game the system. It is not right or fair on those who play by the rules. 'The British people want us to put an end to illegal migration – I am determined to crack down on these immoral lawyers and stop the boats.' Lawyers who coach migrants on how to fraudulently remain in Britain can be prosecuted under the Immigration Act 1971 for 'assisting unlawful immigration to the UK'.

A Freedom of Information request revealed the cost of works at Manston in Kent, where all asylum seekers arriving on small boats are detained for initial processing. The facility, which became unlawfully overcrowded and saw a diphtheria outbreak last autumn, previously had murals of Disney characters including Anna from Frozen on the walls of its children and families unit. Following a visit in February, the prisons watchdog praised the area for being “decorated in bright cheerful colours”. But it emerged last month that the murals had been painted over by the Home Office, along with similar cartoons of Mickey Mouse and other characters at the separate Kent Intake Unit. In response to a Freedom of Information request by a member of the public, the Home Office said the “redecoration” of reception areas at Manston had cost £1,549.52. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick previously told MPs that there “was no financial cost to paint over the murals in the Kent Intake Unit”. He claimed he ordered the move because they were not “age-appropriate”, after being accused of losing “sight of humanity” with his intervention. “THE COHORT OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WHO PASSED THROUGH [THE KENT INTAKE UNIT] LAST YEAR WERE LARGELY TEENAGERS AND WE DIDN’T FEEL THE SITE WAS AGE-APPROPRIATE, BUT IT DOES CONTAIN A RANGE OF SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND INFANTS,” MR JENRICK TOLD THE HOUSE OF COMMONS LAST MONTH. Murals, photographed by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, were painted over on the immigration minister’s orders at the Kent Intake Unit (HM Inspectorate of Prisons) “Nothing about the decoration of sites changes the fundamentals that if someone comes to the UK we will treat them with decency and compassion at all times.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said that painting over cartoons would not “deter” small boats, and accused the minister of trampling over “common decency towards vulnerable children”. The Freedom From Torture charity accused the government of “losing sight of its humanity”, while Labour MP Stella Creasy compared the minister to a “cartoon villain”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-painting-children-cartoons-detention-b2389497.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230810154222/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-painting-children-cartoons-detention-b2389497.html

JUSTICE SECRETARY ALEX CHALK HAS URGED THE REGULATOR TO USE THE ""FULL FORCE OF SANCTIONS"" AT ITS DISPOSAL. Writing to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Mr Chalk said: ""Solicitors are critical to the operation of a fair immigration system. I know that the overwhelming majority take their professional duties and obligations extremely seriously. ""However, any examples of practices which fall short of the high ethical standards we expect of solicitors risk serious disruption to the immigration system, tarnishing the reputation of those working in this area, and critically undermining public confidence."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak echoed his minister's sentiments saying: ""It is vital that those found to be abusing their position face the full consequences of their actions."" A spokesperson for the regulator said: ""We can confirm we are investigating the firms/individuals. As a result of the information provided, we are looking to take urgent action to make sure the public are protected. ""If we find evidence that solicitors or firms we regulate have acted in ways that contravene our rules, and in particular their duty to act legally and uphold the law, we can and will take action."" Last November, the regulator carried out a review of the immigration and asylum sector which concluded it was generally ""satisfied with the quality of service being provided"". Following the review it issued new guidance on immigration work and committed to producing a further report in 12 to 18 months. Mr Chalk said the follow-up review should be carried out ""as soon as possible"". The Solicitors Regulation Authority monitors more than 200,000 solicitors in England and Wales. As part of its work it monitors solicitors to ensure they are complying with the rules and investigates concerns. It also has the power to close down firms.

The latest figure is nearly double that of 2018, just five years ago.

According to internal Government projections, the cost of this plan cost an eye-watering £6bn over two years. Chief policy analyst at the Refugee Council, Jon Featonby, said: “The Home Office is clearly aware that so-called deterrence measures simply don't work, and it is preparing to detain thousands of desperate people who will end up on our shores in search of protection.”",https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1777328/Robert-Jenrick-immigration-riddled-with-abuse,http://web.archive.org/web/20241213161138/https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1777328/Robert-Jenrick-immigration-riddled-with-abuse

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. MR KINNOCK SAID HIS PARTY AGREED WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT ASYLUM SEEKERS SHOULD BE MOVED OUT OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION – THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND SUELLA BRAVERMAN'S PUSH TO HOUSE THEM ON SHIPS AND IN MILITARY CAMPS. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” Ms Cates questioned the decision to keep care workers on the occupation shortage list, a designation that allows the sector to bring lower-skilled workers into the country to fill positions, suggesting it was a Covid policy that had not delivered. She said the country had “record levels of migration, and we’ve still not solved the care crisis”, with Ms Cates instead arguing that the solution was to “train up our own people to do the work” and “improve the pay conditions so that people want to do it”. Mr Kruger said the group, along with his party, were rallying against the “establishment” when it came to migration reforms. “There is an establishment in this country, which the Conservative leadership and our colleagues here are not part of, and that is the establishment that we’re fighting against, that resists these proposals, particularly on immigration,” he said. Downing Street said the Government had no plan to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list and downplayed the prospect of blocking foreign university students from staying in the UK after graduation – another recommendation made by the New Conservatives group. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to say whether Mr Sunak was frustrated by Mr Anderson’s support for tougher migration rules but acknowledged there were “different views on each side”. Home Secretary Suella Braverman faced a question from Tory MP James Daly in the Commons about raising the main skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 per annum, a recommendation made in Mr Hunt’s report. MRS BRAVERMAN TOLD HIM SHE RECOGNISED THAT “NET MIGRATION IS TOO HIGH” AND THAT OVERALL NUMBERS NEEDED TO BE REDUCED. She earlier told MPs: “We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-prime-minister-lee-anderson-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230712025821/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-prime-minister-lee-anderson-b2368581.html

It comes as the Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge – part of the government’s plan to crackdown on illegal arrivals –was met by protesters as it arrived into Dorset’s Portland Port. Rishi Sunak announced last month that two more vessels would be used for accommodation as part of efforts to deter small boats and reduce the £6m daily cost of hotel accommodation. But plans for one of the boats to house migrants near Liverpool have been scrapped after being declined by the port operator while another vessel was refused docking near Edinburgh, according to Sky News. No 10 did not deny the report, saying the government was still in talks to “open more” accommodation sites at docks elsewhere in Britain. The prime minister’s spokesman told reporters: “We are continuing discussions both in terms of those who can provide additional accommodation facilities and sites where it can be housed.” It is not yet clear how much the Sunak government paid for the two cruise ships before they were returned to the owner. The Home Office said it would not comment on arrangements with vessel owners, saying officials had been looking at a “range of accommodation options which offer better value for the British taxpayer than expensive hotels”. A spokesperson added: “This is why we will be using alternative accommodation options, such as barges, which are more manageable for communities, as our European neighbours are doing.” Protesters in Portland in Dorset after the Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge arrived (Ben Birchall/PA) (PA Wire) Labour’s shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the latest development showed the “incompetence of this Conservative government knows no limits”. Mr Kinnock said the backlog of asylum cases had grown nine-fold under the Tory government, pushing the costs to £3.6bn. “THEY ARE NOW SHIFTING TO YET ANOTHER PLAN THAT HASN’T BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH – SPENDING MONEY ON BOATS THAT HAVE NOWHERE TO DOCK.” ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ONBOARD BIBBY STOCKHOLM FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK AS FURTHER WORK IS DONE TO MAKE IT SUITABLE FOR HABITATION. The Independent understands the vessel must be connected to the Portland Port’s fresh water, mains sewage network and other services, after this it will undergo more tests. An official brochure showed there were only 222 “single en-suite bedrooms” – meaning that at least two people will have to be crammed into every cabin for the government to achieve its claimed capacity. Protests at Portland came as the government hailed the passage of the Illegal Migration Bill, aimed at making sure detained people are promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda – still the subject of a legal challenge. UN human rights chief Volker Turk and UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi led outrage at the plans – saying it could violate international law. “This new legislation significantly erodes the legal framework that has protected so many, exposing refugees to grave risks in breach of international law.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/asylum-cruise-ship-barge-suella-braverman-b2377965.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230829195911/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/asylum-cruise-ship-barge-suella-braverman-b2377965.html

If this Government fails to humanely address this issue, then innocent lives will continue to be lost.” Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the incident “underscores the need for meaningful action” to reduce dangerous crossings, and urged the Government to focus on creating an “orderly and humane asylum system”. “We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in today’s sinking of a boat in the English Channel. Our hearts go out to the victims, survivors, and their loved ones. We also thank the rescuers who helped save many lives under harrowing circumstances,” he said. He accused the Government of “focusing on passing expensive and unworkable legislation and shutting down existing safe ways to get to the UK”, adding: “There are constructive alternatives we have set out that would create an orderly and humane asylum system.” Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it is “desperately” necessary to stop dangerous crossings and “the terrible criminal smuggling gangs who profit while lives are lost.” “Awful news coming from Channel. Another tragedy with yet more lives lost or at risk,” she said. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the latest incident was an “appalling, deeply shocking tragedy”. “We must stop these crossings and defeat the criminal people smugglers,” he wrote on Twitter. “There can be no more headline-chasing gimmicks or madcap schemes that just make everything worse.” Natalie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, said the fatal incident reinforced the need for joint patrols in the Channel. “Today’s tragedy underlines why we must stop the small boats to keep people safe and prevent loss of life in the Channel,” she said. “THESE OVERCROWDED AND UNSEAWORTHY DEATHTRAPS SHOULD OBVIOUSLY BE STOPPED BY THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES FROM LEAVING THE FRENCH COAST IN THE FIRST PLACE. “The time has come for joint patrols on the French coast and a cross-Channel security zone before any more lives are lost.” A UK Government spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident in the Channel. HM Coastguard are working on a co-ordinated response and further information will be provided in due course.” Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: “My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic loss of life in the Channel today. “I have spoken with our Border Force teams this morning who have been supporting the French authorities in response to this incident.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/channel-uk-government-nhs-government-natalie-elphicke-b2392031.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/channel-uk-government-nhs-government-natalie-elphicke-b2392031.html

The rooms in the hotel in Pimlico, Westminster are small and asylum seekers had previously been sharing two to a room. The Home Office said it wanted to increase the number of asylum seekers sharing one room to save money. Several asylum seekers told the Guardian there was not enough space to fit four people into one small room, that they had to store their clothes on the little floor space available, and that the claustrophobic conditions were stressful. ACCORDING TO A LETTER POSTED ON TWITTER ON 8 JUNE TO ADAM HUG, THE LEADER OF WESTMINSTER COUNCIL, THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER, ROBERT JENRICK, SAID THE DECISION TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS IN ONE ROOM WAS PART OF A PLAN TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF HOTELS USED TO ACCOMMODATE ASYLUM SEEKERS BY 90 AND WOULD SAVE £250M A YEAR. Hug and Jenrick have traded accusations on the social media platform about the whose fault the protest was. Hug said the Home Office had not informed the council in advance of the arrival of more than 40 additional asylum seekers to this hotel in the course of meetings. He accused the Home Office of “having mismanaged that process” and leaving people “standing on the street outside the hotel for the entire night”. Hug understands that the group were sharing two to a room in their previous hotel, but when they arrived in Pimlico they were asked to share with three others. This prompted the protest, which was resolved when the Home Office reverted to rooms of two. Jenrick said there were “numerous incorrect and misleading statements” made by Hug in a previous letter he wrote to the Home Office about the asylum seekers’ Pimlico pavement protest. “First, you stated that 40 asylum seekers were placed on the streets of Westminster. That is not true. All the individuals involved claimed to be destitute and as a result a generous offer of accommodation was made to each of them by the Home Office, using taxpayer funds, to accommodate them in the hotel concerned. Some individuals initially turned down this offer and instead chose to stand outside the hotel in protest of their own volition.” Jenrick added: “It is fair and reasonable to require people to share a room.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rishi Sunak led criticism of rogue solicitors and legal advisers after our undercover investigation. The Prime Minister retweeted a link to the Mail’s investigation, saying: ‘This is what we’re up against. 'The Labour Party, a subset of lawyers, criminal gangs – they’re all on the same side, propping up a system of exploitation that profits from getting people to the UK illegally.’ Writing in the Mail today, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the probe was ‘hugely important’ and warned some of the practices were ‘potentially criminal’. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK TWEETED: ‘THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE NO PLACE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION. Swift action must be taken to remove from the roll all those who so egregiously abuse our laws.’ Questions surround what law could be used to prosecute solicitors and legal advisers who concoct fake stories for asylum seekers or who submit knowingly false claims. Immigrants who submit false asylum claims can face two years in jail, but there is no specific law covering the solicitors who cash in by helping them. Labour’s shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said: ‘What has been recorded in these conversations is absolutely disgraceful, and it is appalling to think that the same advice may also have been given in numerous real-life cases that we do not know about. 'It is vital that we have a credible asylum process in our country, and it is disgusting to see any legal professional actively working to undermine it. ‘If there is evidence that they have facilitated fraudulent asylum claims in real-life cases, and made financial gains from doing so, then that should rightly be a matter for immediate investigation by the police.’ Alistair Carmichael, Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, added: ‘These reports are extremely concerning and need to be looked into. 'The Government’s approach is failing to tackle the trafficking gangs and all those who profit from this trade in human misery.’ Gareth Johnson, a Tory MP who also works as a solicitor, said: ‘This sort of despicable behaviour brings the whole profession into disrepute. 'If this goes unchecked if this goes it brings the whole profession down, so we need sanctions taken against these people.’ Legal authorities suggested those exposed by the Mail’s investigation could fall foul of section 25 of the 1971 Immigration Act, which prohibits facilitating illegal migration. 'But this is thought to apply only to those who help the act of unlawful entry, not helping the illegal immigrants after they have arrived. Alternatively, if they were knowingly helping people smuggler or crime gangs from the UK they could be in breach of this law. 'There is no suggestion the lawyers featured in the Mail’s investigation were doing do. There has been at least one conviction of a British-based lawyer under such law. On social media, senior lawyers discussing our story debated alternative grounds for a prosecution. 'Dinah Rose, a barrister and president of Magdalen College, Oxford, suggested that if lawyers encouraged clients to lie it could constitute ‘conspiracy to pervert the course of justice’ – a view supported by fellow barrister Adam Wagner. Among the rogue legal advisers we exposed was VP Lingajothy, who asked for £10,000 to invent a horrific back story to use in the asylum application, including claims of sexual torture, slave labour and imprisonment. After the Mail approached the south London firm he was representing, he was promptly sacked.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12337257/Calls-police-investigate-Mails-shocking-expose-rogue-solicitors-legal-advisors-allegedly-telling-migrants-way-asylum-ministers-opposition-MPs-hit-disgraceful-revelations.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12337257/Calls-police-investigate-Mails-shocking-expose-rogue-solicitors-legal-advisors-allegedly-telling-migrants-way-asylum-ministers-opposition-MPs-hit-disgraceful-revelations.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

David Neal, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, cited numerous concerns about the process of removing foreign offenders and the process of record-keeping within the Home Office. Ministers in recent months have repeatedly stressed the Government’s push to remove foreign national offenders – those who have been convicted of an offence in the UK and sentenced to at least 12 months in prison. Mr Neal, in his foreword to the report, said that the Home Office “frequently cites its determination to remove foreign national offenders”. This is no way to run a government department But the watchdog found repeated problems in Home Office operations, describing the approach to record-keeping in one particular area as “no way to run a government department”. In the Commons on Thursday, Labour’s Yvette Cooper attacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman over the “damning” report. “She is running it. THIS HOME SECRETARY IS RUNNING THIS CHAOS, FAILING TO SORT OUT THE BOATS CRISIS, FAILING TO CLEAR THE BACKLOG OR MEND THE BROKEN ASYLUM SYSTEM. Failing to get a grip.” The 84-page report offered a detailed look at the removal process and in his foreword Mr Neal found that the “Home Office’s performance in this area is not efficient”. Mr Neal cited particular concerns about the “underperforming” early removal scheme and the availability of data. He wrote: “This inspection found that the only way for the Home Office to identify a nationality cohort awaiting deportation was to manually trawl through multiple spreadsheets. For an operation of this size to be run like this is unacceptable. “For any operation to be effective, there needs to be a single version of the truth, and for FNOs (foreign national offenders) it does not exist. Worryingly, I found no evidence of a strategy to build one.” Elsewhere, he found that there was “insufficient information to effectively identify which FNOs could be removed from the country today”. He said: “The Home Office does not have an overarching view of its case-working system. In order to establish the current state of a particular case, case owners have to manually interrogate individual case records. “This is no way to run a government department.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/home-office-suella-braverman-yvette-cooper-independent-commons-b1091173.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/home-office-suella-braverman-yvette-cooper-independent-commons-b1091173.html

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has previously indicated she would not be able to immediately shut down the sites but declined to be explicit about the policy. On Sunday, Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast: “The reality is that we’ve got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too. “Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels.” Mr Kinnock said he cannot give a specific timeline as ministers work to bring down the decisions backlog from a record high of more than 172,000 cases.

After a tense confrontation with 40 asylum seekers who took to the streets of central London in protest, the government has decided to implement the policy across the UK. The government hopes to save more than £250 million by forcing asylum seekers to share rooms. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the UK asylum system is ""riddled with abuse."" He said a lot of progress has been made on illegal migration in a short period of time with ""really unique landmark deals"" with France seeing a ""big increase"" in the number of interceptions on the beaches. But he said the asylum system - which according to Mr Jenrick has a backlog of more than 150,000 cases - must be changed ""fundamentally"". Migrants protested in London over hotel conditions He told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: ""The asylum system is riddled with abuse, we have to be honest with ourselves. ""The way to tackle that is by changing fundamentally the way we handle asylum."" Mr Jenrick said the Illegal Migration Bill to detain migrants who arrive through unauthorised means before returning them home or to a third country, such as Rwanda, will alleviate the pressure.

In a letter to the Home Secretary, the leader of Westminster City Council expressed his ""deep concern"" that around 40 refugees were placed in the borough on Wednesday night ""without appropriate accommodation or support available"" and no prior communication with the local authority. Speaking about the incident, Jenrick told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: ""As I understand what happened here was that these migrants, who had themselves said that they were destitute, they had nowhere to stay, we had offered them a safe bed with board and lodgings in a good-quality hotel in central London. ""Yes, some of them had to share with other people. These are single adult males: I don't think that's unreasonable. ""We want to reduce the cost to the taxpayer.

Lee Waters, who represents Llanelli, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast it was because the UK government had not got on top of asylum applications. The Home Office said the asylum system was ""under incredible strain"". Wales created a sanctuary scheme which aims to provide a safe place for refugees. This builds on the British and Irish City of Sanctuary project which ""encourage inclusivity, solidarity and compassion for people from a forced displacement background,"" according to its website.

THIS IS AFTER ALL THE MP WHO HAS CHALLENGED BREXIT PROTESTERS TO FIST FIGHTS, CLAIMED THAT FOODBANK USERS “CAN’T COOK”, AND SUPPORTS THE DEATH PENALTY, ON THE GROUNDS THAT “NOBODY HAS EVER COMMITTED A CRIME AFTER BEING EXECUTED”. Anderson is what he is, his defenders are fond of saying. But what he is now starting to infect the rest of the Tory party. The response of Alex Chalk, an otherwise sensible MP, was particularly surprising. On LBC yesterday he said there was “nothing unreasonable in principle with what [Anderson] was saying… Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people”. Although his language was “salty”, he said “his indignation is well placed”. British voters are perfectly capable of telling between loudly trumpeted intentions and actual results Anderson’s language was disgraceful. Why wouldn’t Chalk at least condemn it in stronger terms? Why wouldn’t No 10? Although polls show the public is concerned about illegal immigration, there is no evidence it wants asylum seekers to be insulted and treated badly. Perhaps there is only one conclusion to draw: the Government is too timid to condemn Anderson’s outburst because it does not itself feel confident on the small boats issue. Anderson’s lowest common denominator guff is of course a cack-handed version of the populist’s “straight talk” — a brand of anti-rhetoric rhetoric. It is a gift to those who want to seem authentic, but as Donald Trump has demonstrated, it does not always go hand in hand with the truth. So with the Government’s policies on asylum seekers. The language is starting to drift ever further from the actual achievements. In fact the stronger the language, the weaker the position. It’s not just Anderson’s comments. This week is Stop the Boats Week — a phrase only rivalled by the Professional Enablers Taskforce, the Home Office’s name for a new group tasked with tracking down “Lefty lawyers” who want to help illegal immigrants. Yet for all the harsh and inflammatory language, little progress has been made. So far just 15 asylum seekers have boarded the Bibby Stockholm, the barge in Dorset which is supposedly set to accommodate some 500 migrants. The Home Office is now threatening a further 20 with withdrawal of their housing benefit. The hunt for “Lefty lawyers” turned up just five of them last year and seven in 2021. Meanwhile, the Rwanda scheme has been foundering since it began. Although it has now been ruled legal, there is little sign it will ever get up and running. As Conservative Home’s Henry Hill has pointed out, the answer to many of the Government’s problems with dealing with illegal immigration is to invest in infrastructure: a purpose-built detention centre, for example, would be one solution to the griping about putting asylum seekers up in hotels. Instead the Government seems to be pouring money into the production of expensive and unworkable signalling methods. It seems odd that the Conservatives would be stoking public feeling on immigration — pushing it up the agenda — when this is a subject on which they are weak. A recent poll from YouGov shows just nine per cent of the public have confidence the Government will reduce the number of small boats crossing the Channel. Just one per cent are “very confident”. This mirrors public trust in the Rwanda scheme ever producing results — three-quarters of voters think the plan is unlikely to go ahead. “After their abject failure,” Sadiq Khan has said, “all that’s left is stoking up more division and hate.” But creating noise about immigration doesn’t compensate for failure — it exposes it. The risk in taking people like Anderson to represent British voters is that you underestimate them. They are perfectly capable of distinguishing between loudly trumpeted intentions and actual results. And there’s another group of potential voters the party seems to have forgotten about — not every Conservative voter is vehemently opposed to treating asylum seekers with empathy. In the past the party has taken care not to hack away at its more moderate voter base unnecessarily. Voters who support policies to assist those fleeing persecution will only be further turned off the Tory party.

Recall that public sector workers in the UK, including teachers and health workers, have recently embarked on strikes demanding a pay increase across the country. Sunak said if the government is to prioritise paying public sector workers more, the money has to come from somewhere else because he is not prepared to increase people's taxes and does not think it would be responsible or right to borrow more as it would only worsen inflation. “So, what we have done are two things to find this money. The first is, we are going to increase the charges that we have for migrants who are coming to this country when they apply for visas, and indeed something called the immigration health surcharge (IHS), which is the levy that they pay to access the NHS,” Sunak added. According to the prime minister, an increase in fees is imminent, projecting a revenue boost of over one billion pounds. HE NOTED THAT THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS ENCOMPASS A BROAD RANGE OF VISA APPLICATION FEES, WHICH ARE SET TO RISE SIGNIFICANTLY. Similarly, the immigration health surcharge for legal migrants entering the country will be raised. “All of those fees are going to go up, and that will raise over a billion pounds. Across the board, visa application fees are going to go up significantly, and similarly for the immigration health surcharge for migrants who are coming to this country legally.”

The BBC football pundit said he 'didn't know what to do' and described the moment as 'cringe' as it took place while he was at the heart of a media furore over whether his comments were acceptable for a freelancer at the BBC. Lineker responded to a Twitter user who took issue with him commenting on immigration and refugees arriving in the UK by saying: 'This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people, in language not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s and I'm out of order?'

He has joined a swathe of other celebrities who describe being woke as a positive attribute, demonstrating a desire to introduce more empathy and less division into contentious issues.

The Refugee Council urged the Government to respond with “compassion” to the incident while Freedom from Torture accused ministers of “hostile” attitudes towards refugee protection. Opposition MPs said the tragedy highlighted the need for action to prevent dangerous crossings being made. Kolbassia Haoussou, from Freedom from Torture, said: “The tragic news of yet more deaths in the Channel, including serious injuries to many others, demonstrates the continued failure of the UK Government’s hostile approach to refugee protection. “The UK Government has used the demonisation of refugees as a tactic to distract us from their failings, which have left us with a cost-of-living crisis, the NHS on its knees, and public sector strikes. If this Government fails to humanely address this issue, then innocent lives will continue to be lost.” Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the incident “underscores the need for meaningful action” to reduce dangerous crossings, and urged the Government to focus on creating an “orderly and humane asylum system”. “We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in today’s sinking of a boat in the English Channel. Our hearts go out to the victims, survivors, and their loved ones. We also thank the rescuers who helped save many lives under harrowing circumstances,” he said. He accused the Government of “focusing on passing expensive and unworkable legislation and shutting down existing safe ways to get to the UK”, adding: “There are constructive alternatives we have set out that would create an orderly and humane asylum system.” Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it is “desperately” necessary to stop dangerous crossings and “the terrible criminal smuggling gangs who profit while lives are lost.” “Awful news coming from Channel. Another tragedy with yet more lives lost or at risk,” she said. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the latest incident was an “appalling, deeply shocking tragedy”. “WE MUST STOP THESE CROSSINGS AND DEFEAT THE CRIMINAL PEOPLE SMUGGLERS,” HE WROTE ON TWITTER. “There can be no more headline-chasing gimmicks or madcap schemes that just make everything worse.” Natalie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, said the fatal incident reinforced the need for joint patrols in the Channel. “Today’s tragedy underlines why we must stop the small boats to keep people safe and prevent loss of life in the Channel,” she said. “These overcrowded and unseaworthy deathtraps should obviously be stopped by the French authorities from leaving the French coast in the first place. “The time has come for joint patrols on the French coast and a cross-Channel security zone before any more lives are lost.” A UK Government spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident in the Channel. HM Coastguard are working on a co-ordinated response and further information will be provided in due course.” Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: “My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic loss of life in the Channel today. “I have spoken with our Border Force teams this morning who have been supporting the French authorities in response to this incident.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/channel-uk-government-nhs-government-natalie-elphicke-b2392031.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/channel-uk-government-nhs-government-natalie-elphicke-b2392031.html

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" from crossing the English Channel as one of his five pledges after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of hundreds of migrants in hotels after record numbers arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. The opposition Labour Party said Sunak had failed to clear the backlog of tens of thousands of asylum claims and that 7,600 people had crossed the English Channel so far this year - a total that is likely to increase over the summer months. Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving and a toughening of the country's stance on immigration can produce results. He said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country and that London was increasing its provision of accommodation for those awaiting immigration decisions. He said the government had secured two new vessels to house migrants to move them out of hotels. Sunak said so far this year, ""the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%"" and that Britain was now accepting one in 50 Albanian asylum cases compared with one in five previously. He urged parliament to pass his new Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for the swift detention and deportation of people arriving on small boats back to their homeland or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda. It is now in the upper house of parliament, where peers could try to weaken some its provisions. ""This won't be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it's so important that we change the law,"" he said. ""My policy is very simple: it is this country - and your government - who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. I WILL DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE IT.

In a ruling on Thursday, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the practice is unlawful and had been used since at least December 2021. Following the ruling, ECPAT’s chief executive, Patricia Durr, said: “It remains a child protection scandal that so many of the most vulnerable children remain missing at risk of significant harm as a consequence of these unlawful actions by the Secretary of State and Kent County Council.” The court has confirmed that there can be no exceptions when the rights of vulnerable children are concerned Enver Solomon, Refugee Council She added the decision was a “clear and timely reminder” about the legal obligations of local and national government towards all children in the wake of the passing of the Illegal Migration Act.

Mr Solomon added: “Most importantly, we are still waiting to hear what is happening to the 154 children who are still missing. “THERE CAN BE NO COMPROMISE WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN’S SAFETY AND WELFARE, AND WE HOPE THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO FIND THE MISSING CHILDREN AND ENSURE THEY ARE SAFE.” CHILDREN’S CHARITY THE NSPCC SAID IT WOULD BE “URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO FIND SOLUTIONS” TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT ALL CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMING TO THE UK.

A department spokesperson continued: “However, due to the unsustainable rise in illegal Channel crossings, the Government has had no option but to accommodate young people in hotels on a temporary basis while placements with local authorities are urgently found. “In light of today’s judgment, we will continue to work with Kent County Council and local authorities across the UK to ensure suitable local authority placements are provided for unaccompanied children, in line with their duties.”",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-12345381/Ruling-child-asylum-seekers-hotels-landmark-day-children-s-rights.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-12345381/Ruling-child-asylum-seekers-hotels-landmark-day-children-s-rights.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. SINCE ALMOST ONE-FIFTH OF UK STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION NOW COME FROM ABROAD – 125,000 OF THEM FROM CHINA – THERE IS NEAR PANIC AT THE HOME OFFICE’S DETERMINATION TO SLASH STUDENT IMMIGRATION. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. British students already graduate with the highest rate of student debt, in the order of £40,000 to £50,000, and an increasing number wonder if it is worth it. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education

The New Conservatives group of backbenchers wants to reduce the number of study visas by around 75,000 by excluding the worst universities from eligibility. 1 Tory MPs say slashing immigration must not be compromised to prop up universities Credit: Alamy It is among 12 demands they are making to Rishi Sunak in a new report which they believe will reduce net migration by 400,000. Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”. Yesterday the 25-strong New Conservatives insisted they were not “rebels” and fully supported the PM. Tory Party deputy Lee Anderson fuelled speculation he had been reined in by No10 after pulling out of the event at the last minute - but later claimed to be sick. But the caucus warned Mr Sunak would lose the next election if he “kicked the can” of immigration down the road. RED WALL MP MIRIAM CATES SAID FAILING TO KEEP NUMBERS DOWN “RAISES DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT NATIONAL AND CULTURAL SECURITY”. She said: “Particularly in towns and cities, a huge volume of immigration over over the last 10 years particularly, those of course, change the culture in society very significantly.” Hitting back at critics, Mr Hunt said it was “disparaging to label people xenophobes” for voicing fears about migration. Bury MP James Daly said immigration is the biggest issue to his voters “by a million miles”. And Danny Kruger said his cabal were rallying against the “establishment” on migration reforms. The PM’s spokesman said: “We have to strike the right balance between tackling net migration and ensuring we have the right style to match the needs of the public.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/,http://web.archive.org/web/20230711205606/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The Justice Secretary has defended the Government’s announcement of a “task force” for identifying corrupt immigration lawyers as critics branded it a “red herring” to distract from the asylum backlog. Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. TOURING BROADCAST STUDIOS ON TUESDAY, HE SAID IT WAS RIGHT TO ROOT OUT A “TINY MINORITY” OF LAWYERS DAMAGING THE REPUTATION OF OTHERS IN THE PROFESSION. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed For Labour, shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said it is “too little too late” and the “buck stops” with the Conservatives, accusing them of having “sat idly by for 13 years while illegal migration has spun out of control”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,

MR HAMMOND, NOW A TORY PEER, SAID THAT THE MOVE COULD ACT TO BRING DOWN STUBBORNLY HIGH INFLATION BEING DRIVEN BY RISING WAGES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR INTEREST RATE RISES HAMMERING HOMEOWNERS. The former Remain campaigner lamented to LBC that when the UK was in the EU the single market and free movement would have allowed people to enter and work, but that that was no longer possible. 'That's not happening now. And I think the government has regarded any relaxation of migration rules as being politically toxic,' he said. 'But rising mortgage rates on the scale we're seeing is also politically toxic. I think we might have to have a debate about the balance between the two… 'I would guess there are plenty of people around now who are facing enormous personal financial pressures because of rising mortgage rates either now or anticipating them for when their current fixed rate deals. Mr Hammond, now a Tory peer, said that the move could act to bring down stubbornly high inflation being driven by rising wages without the need for interest rate rises hammering homeowners. Speculation is swirling that the Monetary Policy Committee might even opt for a 0.5 percentage point rise today from the current 4.5 per cent The average two-year mortgage has hit 6.15 per cent, while government borrowing has also become massively more expensive Shock figures yesterday showing prices still not slowing down have made a bump to 5 per cent a real possibility 'And that even if they were, in principle, people who liked the idea of tighter migration controls, might be willing to embrace the concept that a lower cost way of getting wage inflation down would be to soften the labour market rather than dampen the whole economy.' It came as Brits prepare for another hammer blow today with the Bank of England poised to hike rates for the 13th time in a row to curb rampant inflation. Markets are pricing in a 0.25 percentage point rise to 4.75 per cent when the latest decision by the Monetary Policy Committee is announced at noon. But shock figures yesterday showing prices still not slowing down have made a bump to 5 per cent a real possibility - heaping more agony on mortgage-payers. The respected IFS think-tank has warned that 1.4million people are set to lose a fifth of their disposable income due to the soaring costs. BoE governor Andrew Bailey has been coming under intense fire for failing to respond to inflation earlier, with some Treasury advisers arguing that Threadneedle Street now has no option but to force a recession. Rishi Sunak has batted away Tory demands for tax breaks or other support for homeowners from the government, and renewed his vow to CPI inflation by the end of the year. Labour has said banks should be obliged to let crippled mortgage-payers switch to interest-only or extend their terms - even though this hugely increases their liabilities in the long run. Panic was sparked when official figures showed headline inflation sticking at 8.7 per cent, defying expectations of a fall to 8.4 per cent and suggesting surging prices have become embedded in the economy. To hit Mr Sunak's target it will have to be slashed to no more than 5.4 per cent by the end of the year. Markets were particularly alarmed that core inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as food and energy, actually rose from 6.8 per cent to 7.1 per cent, driven in part by rising wages. Traders pushed up borrowing costs, assuming that the BoE will use its only tool to combat inflation and push up interest rates. The average two-year mortgage has hit 6.15 per cent, while government borrowing has also become massively more expensive raising questions about public services and Tory hopes of tax cuts this Autumn. Mr Sunak, who will hold a question and answer session with voters today, insisted inflation would be brought under control.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12222643/Ex-chancellor-Philip-Hammond-says-UK-RELAX-immigration-rules-avoid-recession.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12222643/Ex-chancellor-Philip-Hammond-says-UK-RELAX-immigration-rules-avoid-recession.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Sir Trevor, previously served as chair of the London Assembly, also stressed the importance of people from different ethnic groups mixing with each other rather than living in separate communities. He questioned whether the British model of multiculturalism was working when in some towns and cities people would mix together at work but in the evenings go back to areas 'in which everybody who lives there are people like themselves'. He listed Burney, Preston and Leicester and some towns in the North West as examples of this phenomenon. The number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the Channel recently topped 20,000.

Any attempt to remove the tag and abscond would result in any right to bail or to remain in the UK being automatically withdrawn.

Ministers reacted with fury to the Court of Appeal verdict in favour of several asylum seekers and a charity fighting against the Government policy. Campaigners called for the Government to drop its plans to send asylum applicants to Rwanda following the court ruling that the plan to deport migrants was unlawful amid concerns over the east African nation's asylum system. In a majority decision, judges overturned an earlier High Court ruling that said Rwanda could be considered a “safe third country”. The Government said it would seek to appeal against the ruling, with the Prime Minister saying he “fundamentally” disagreed with the decision.

The decision is the latest setback in Mr Sunak’s bid to “stop the boats” – one of his flagship pledges. Ms Braverman insisted that she still had “every confidence” in the plan while stressing that Rwanda was a safe country. Suella Braverman has vowed to continue with her asylum policy When asked if she blamed “lefty lawyers” or “the blob” amid the defeat, she told broadcasters: “The system is rigged against the British people, it’s as simple as that. “It’s why we’re changing the laws through our Illegal Migration Bill.” She then doubled down on her claims in the Commons, telling MPs that “phoney humanitarianism” was holding back plans to tackle Channel crossings. But Labour said the decision showed the Government’s efforts were “completely unravelling”. Sir Keir Starmer slammed the policy as a “headline-grabbing gimmick”, telling the PA news agency during a visit to North Yorkshire: “What the court’s judgment shows is they’ve spent that £140m of taxpayers’ money without even doing the basics to see whether the scheme was really fit for purpose.” SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

HOME SECRETARY SUELLA BRAVERMAN HAD PREVIOUSLY SAID ANY MIGRANTS WHO ARRIVED SINCE MARCH BY 'IRREGULAR' ROUTES – SUCH AS ON DINGHIES ACROSS THE CHANNEL – WOULD BE BARRED FROM MAKING ASYLUM CLAIMS. But in a major concession to get the Government's Illegal Migration Bill through Parliament, it will now apply only to migrants who reach the UK after the legislation gains Royal Assent. Official figures show 9,622 migrants arrived on small boats between March 7 and Sunday. The Home Secretary's concession means they will now be able to claim asylum under existing rules – meaning many are likely to stay in Britain indefinitely. Official figures show 9,622 migrants arrived on small boats between March 7 and Sunday Mrs Braverman said: 'This Bill forms a crucial part of our action to stop the boats and ensure people do not risk their lives by making illegal and unnecessary journeys to the UK. Today's amendments will help this crucial legislation pass through Parliament swiftly, whilst continuing to send a clear message that the exploitation of children and vulnerable people, used by criminals and ferried across the Channel, cannot continue.' The Government's Bill suffered 20 defeats in the House of Lords as peers sought to water down its measures. It now faces a tortuous series of votes in the Commons as the Government seeks to erase peers' changes. If it passes the 'ping-pong' stage between the two Houses today and tomorrow, the Bill could gain Royal Assent – and become law – within days. In a further sop to the Lords, Mrs Braverman tabled further amendments which will increase safeguards around the detention of unaccompanied child migrants. If a child is detained for removal from Britain, an immigration judge will be able to grant bail after eight days instead of the previous proposal of 28 days. In a further concession, the Home Office will be able to detain pregnant women for a maximum of 72 hours, extendable to seven days on a ministers' authorisation. Migrants who arrived since March 7 will still face bans on re-entering the UK and will be excluded from gaining settlement or citizenship in this country. Migrants who arrived since March 7 will still face bans on re-entering the UK and will be excluded from gaining settlement or citizenship in this country The Home Office confirmed that 269 migrants reached Britain across the Channel on Sunday, bringing the total so far this year to 12,772, compared with 13,286 at the same point last year. It came as former home secretary and chancellor Ken Clarke said the Rwanda deal – which will see migrants sent to claim asylum in the east African nation rather than here – is the only way to stop small-boat crossings. 'We can no longer simply do nothing. We must give the Rwanda scheme a chance to work,' Lord Clarke, who is on the liberal wing of the Tory party, wrote in The Daily Telegraph.  A man wanted in connection with a tragedy which saw 27 migrants drown in the Channel in 2021 has been extradited to France.

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER {{ /VERIFYERRORS }} FORMER HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF BEING “SECRETIVE ABOUT ITS INTENTIONS” TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS ON A FORMER MILITARY BASE. Ministers claim that accommodating 1,700 migrants at RAF Wethersfield in Essex will be cheaper than hotels, but a leaked Home Office memo showed that “value for money” will not be achieved unless the site is used for five years. Suella Braverman declared an “emergency” earlier this year to bypass normal planning permission for the development, but the process only allows 12-month use and is the subject of a looming legal challenge in the High Court. Her predecessor Ms Patel, who is the MP for the nearby constituency of Witham, has opposed the use of Wethersfield for asylum accommodation and maintained it is “unsuitable”. In a letter to Ms Braverman and immigration minister Robert Jenrick on Monday, she said the leaked memo showed they planned to use the site for longer than previously disclosed, and that local representatives had been given “no clarity” on timescales. “The lack of a direct response to my questions relating to the length of time the Home Office plans to use the site for asylum accommodation gives the impression that the Home Office is being evasive,” she wrote. “Clear answers now need to be provided by the Home Office and the government must be transparent rather than evasive. The lack of clarity has been alarming and staggering and I trust you will resolve this urgently.” Ms Patel said official government statements had said only that the site would be “temporary” and under “constant review”, adding: “This suggests that the government is being secretive about its intentions, but the local community and partners need to know what the government’s plans are. “In planning terms, the temporary Class Q use is for twelve months only but it seems that the government are intending on using the site for longer than that.” Ms Patel demanded urgent answers to questions on how long Wethersfield would be used for, financial modelling for the site and the average costs of housing asylum seekers there. The use of Wethersfield as asylum accommodation is subject to legal action and strong local opposition (AFP via Getty Images) The internal Home Office memo, published byThe Telegraph, said a senior civil servant was “satisfied with value for money” for Wethersfield, the Scampton military base in Lincolnshire and a former prison in Sussex, subject to certain conditions. Wethersfield and HMP Northeye, in Bexhill, would have to be used “across the five years planned for the sites”, the memo said, and Scampton would have to be used for three years. It added: “This [analysis] assume we are in hotels for that period. If we are not, and/or if our costs are higher than we have estimated, there could be issues on value for money.” The memo also said that the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset would need to hold 1,000 people to “provide value for money”. But the vessel’s capacity is 500 and it was evacuated on Friday following the discovery of dangerous legionnella bacteria in the water system. The Home Office moved the first asylum seekers into Wethersfield on 12 July - as a hearing over the base began at the High Court - and cases of tuberculosis and scabies have since been reported. Local councils and residents have launched a legal challenge against the use of the former RAF base, as well as RAF Scampton and HMP Northeye, alleging that the government has acted unlawfully. The High Court heard that Ms Braverman’s attempted planning bypass covered an “emergency” development for 12 months, but Home Office documents indicated that Wethersfield could be used for much longer. Asylum seekers were moved into Wethersfield last month despite an ongoing legal challenge (PA) (PA Wire) Alex Goodman KC said Wethersfield could be occupied for up to five years or “as long as it remains expedient to do so”, amid rocketing Channel crossings, a record asylum backlog and the suspension of unlawful plans to deport small boat migrants to Rwanda. He argued that a series of statutory assessments, including on the environmental impact of housing 1,700 asylum seekers at Wethersfield, were wrongly based on an assumption it would only be used for a year. The councils are also arguing that the current use of hotels for asylum seekers is not an emergency that qualifies for emergency planning permission, despite lawyers representing Ms Braverman claiming a shortage of accommodation created a risk of homelessness. Last month, a parliamentary committee was told that the Home Office was holding 5,000 empty hotel beds for asylum seekers as a “buffer” for expected high crossings. The case could make or break the government’s “alternative accommodation” policy, which is core to Rishi Sunak’s vow to move migrants out of hotels. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Delivering accommodation on surplus military sites will provide cheaper and more orderly, suitable accommodation for those arriving in small boats whilst helping to reduce the use of hotels. “These accommodation sites will house asylum seekers in basic, safe and secure accommodation as they await a decision on their claim. “We understand the concerns of local communities and will work closely with councils and key partners to manage the impact of using these sites, including liaising with local police to make sure appropriate arrangements are in place.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/migrants-military-bases-wethersfield-patel-braverman-b2392730.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230817103014/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/migrants-military-bases-wethersfield-patel-braverman-b2392730.html

The shadow immigration minister, Stephen Kinnock, said the idea makes him “deeply unhappy” as it is the last thing the party wants to do. But he said Labour would have “no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit”. Kinnock told Sky News on Sunday: “Over the last 13 years, the Tory government has destroyed our asylum system. We’ll inherit a mess if we are privileged to win the next election.” When pressed if that meant Labour would continue to use the barges to house asylum seekers, Kinnock said: “The reality is, on day one we will have to deal with the we have and the shambolic mess they have left us. We’ll be left with no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit.” He told BBC Breakfast that he was confident a Labour government could get on top of the backlog within six months. THE SHADOW MINISTER REFUSED TO GIVE A TIMELINE ON WHEN A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD STOP USING THE BARGES AND BRING DOWN THE BACKLOG FROM A RECORD HIGH OF MORE THAN 172,000 CASES. Kinnock’s comments came as the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said checks were still taking place on a controversial barge designed to house asylum seekers, with the first group due to be housed there within “weeks”. He said was confident the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, would become operational soon and that the government was taking into account concerns over fire safety. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph Dowden criticised those who have expressed concern over the asylum seeker barge, urging them to stop their “howls of outrage”. The government is to launch a series of immigration policies this week in an effort to show the prime minister is starting to get a grip on one of his five key priorities – to “stop the boats”. Kinnock, speaking on Sunday morning, also accused the Conservatives of “cooking the books” to show they were getting a grip on the spiralling asylum backlog. “They have been artificially withdrawing claims if someone misses an appointment. It doesn’t mean they’ve been processed, it just puts people into limbo. Then essentially people are just slipping into the underground economy,” Kinnock said. More than 6,000 people have been wiped off the list without being fully assessed in just three months, for reasons such as failing to attend interviews or appointments, and not filling in new fast-track questionnaires, the Independent reported.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/06/labour-would-barges-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-stephen-kinnock,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/06/labour-would-barges-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-stephen-kinnock

Britain launched trade talks with India in January last year, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has stressed that he won't sacrifice quality for speed in negotiations. Last year interior minister Suella Braverman sparked a row with comments about the possible impact of Indian migrants in trade talks, citing concern both with any ""open borders migration policy with India"" and those who overstay visas. Badenoch set out Britain's stance in response to a question about how government ensures it ""speaks with a single voice on migration and mobility in relation to a UK-India trade agreement,"" and avoids ""disruptive political off-stage noises."" ""An FTA with India will not contain commitments on immigration or provide access to the UK domestic labour market,"" Badenoch said in a written response to lawmakers published on Thursday. ""There will also be no agreement to anything which undermines the principles or functioning of the UK's points-based immigration system, or which undermines the UK's ability to control its own border."" She added that the negotiations would discuss business mobility, ""which would make it easier for highly skilled professionals to deliver services in each other's markets on a short-term and temporary basis."" Negotiators were also exploring provisions to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications where it might be possible with regulators, she said. Badenoch has previously warned that the deal may not have everything that the services sector would want. She did not make reference to when negotiations, which have not made quick progress this year, would conclude by, saying she would update lawmakers ""in due course"" on the talks.

4567cce0d4,"Rishi Sunak has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.",Tom Hunt,"[{'name': 'Tom Hunt', 'genere': 'male', 'description': 'British politician and Conservative MP', 'occupations': ['politician'], 'position_held': ['member of the 58th Parliament of the United Kingdom'], 'member_of_political_party': ['Conservative Party'], 'religion_or_worldview': 'N/A', 'political_ideology': 'N/A', 'full_description': 'Tom Hunt (British politician and Conservative MP). He has worked as a politician and has held the position of member of the 58th Parliament of the United Kingdom affiliated with the Conservative Party.'}]","M Ps who came up with a blueprint for reducing the number of migrants arriving lawfully into the UK have insisted they are loyal to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I THINK PARTICULARLY ON ILLEGAL MIGRATION (RISHI SUNAK) HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY BRAVE WITH THE POLICIES HE HAS ADOPTED, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO THE ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL AND HIS CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE RWANDA POLICY “I’LL JUST MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, THAT IS NOT HOW WE SEE IT. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” Ms Cates questioned the decision to keep care workers on the occupation shortage list, a designation that allows the sector to bring lower-skilled workers into the country to fill positions, suggesting it was a Covid policy that had not delivered. She said the country had “record levels of migration, and we’ve still not solved the care crisis”, with Ms Cates instead arguing that the solution was to “train up our own people to do the work” and “improve the pay conditions so that people want to do it”. Mr Kruger said the group, along with his party, were rallying against the “establishment” when it came to migration reforms. “There is an establishment in this country, which the Conservative leadership and our colleagues here are not part of, and that is the establishment that we’re fighting against, that resists these proposals, particularly on immigration,” he said. Downing Street said the Government had no plan to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list and downplayed the prospect of blocking foreign university students from staying in the UK after graduation – another recommendation made by the New Conservatives group. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to say whether Mr Sunak was frustrated by Mr Anderson’s support for tougher migration rules but acknowledged there were “different views on each side”. Home Secretary Suella Braverman faced a question from Tory MP James Daly in the Commons about raising the main skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 per annum, a recommendation made in Mr Hunt’s report. Mrs Braverman told him she recognised that “net migration is too high” and that overall numbers needed to be reduced. She earlier told MPs: “We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-danny-kruger-lee-anderson-b1091832.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-danny-kruger-lee-anderson-b1091832.html

Recall that public sector workers in the UK, including teachers and health workers, have recently embarked on strikes demanding a pay increase across the country. Sunak said if the government is to prioritise paying public sector workers more, the money has to come from somewhere else because he is not prepared to increase people's taxes and does not think it would be responsible or right to borrow more as it would only worsen inflation. “So, what we have done are two things to find this money. The first is, we are going to increase the charges that we have for migrants who are coming to this country when they apply for visas, and indeed something called the immigration health surcharge (IHS), which is the levy that they pay to access the NHS,” Sunak added. According to the prime minister, an increase in fees is imminent, projecting a revenue boost of over one billion pounds. He noted that the proposed adjustments encompass a broad range of visa application fees, which are set to rise significantly. SIMILARLY, THE IMMIGRATION HEALTH SURCHARGE FOR LEGAL MIGRANTS ENTERING THE COUNTRY WILL BE RAISED. “All of those fees are going to go up, and that will raise over a billion pounds. Across the board, visa application fees are going to go up significantly, and similarly for the immigration health surcharge for migrants who are coming to this country legally.”
  The Prime Minister had stated a few weeks earlier at the US embassy that he would be raising fees for processing non-immigrant visa (NIV) applications. According to a statement on the US embassy's website, the new fees for various visa categories will go into effect on Monday, June 17, 2023.",https://guardian.ng/news/uk-increases-visa-fees-health-charges-for-nigerians-other-immigrants/,http://web.archive.org/web/20241214121911/https://guardian.ng/news/uk-increases-visa-fees-health-charges-for-nigerians-other-immigrants/

The Prime Minister ruled out more borrowing and tax rises as ways to fund the £2billion package. Mr Sunak said: “What we have done are two things to find this money. The first is we’re going to increase the charges that we have for migrants who are coming to this country when they apply for visas. “And indeed, something called the immigration health surcharge which is the levy that they pay to access the NHS. So all of those fees are going to go up and that will raise over a billion pounds.” The charity Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, claimed that the Government was treating people born outside the UK as “cash cows”. Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz, its public affairs manager, said raising “already eye-wateringly high” visa fees risks seeing people fall deeper into poverty and insecurity. But Mr Sunak said choices had to be made over funding public sector pay rises. HE ADDED: “I’M NOT SHYING AWAY FROM THAT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT’S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.” AROUND HALF OF THE COST WILL BE MET BY A RISE OF UP TO 20 PER CENT IN VISA FEES AND INCREASING THE IMMIGRATION HEALTH SURCHARGE FROM £624 TO £1,035. Whitehall departments will also have to “reprioritise” resources to help pay the rest of the bill. Mr Sunak insisted that was “not about cuts” but was “just about focusing on public sector workers’ pay rather than other things”. He added: “And I’m really pleased that the teaching unions specifically have said that this pay offer is properly funded.” The classroom unions said they would urge members to accept the offer, which would bring to an end months of strike action. In a joint statement the ASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU said: “A 6½ percent increase for teachers and school leaders recognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession.” They said the offer was “properly funded” and schools will receive extra cash for it. Union chiefs who will put the offer to members said: “This deal will allow teachers and school leaders to call off strike action and resume normal relations with Government.” But doctors’ leaders at the BMA said they feel they had “no option but to take industrial action” after years of below-inflation pay awards. Junior doctors, who yesterday began their longest walkout yet in England, will receive rises of six percent plus a £1,250 bonus. Rishi Sunak explains how he will fund pay rises SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

More info Hospital consultants, due to strike in England next week, will be given six per cent too. Some doctors who are training will receive more than 10 percent. Mr Sunak insisted the awards will not be reviewed, even if some staff take further industrial action. He said: “There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year’s settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.” He urged consultants and junior doctors to accept the pay offer and warned strikes made it “far harder” for care backlogs to be cleared. The PM said the awards were based on recommendations from independent pay review bodies “which we have accepted in full”. He added: “I would urge them to accept this offer from the independent bodies. And that way we can all work collectively together to bring the backlogs down. I know that that’s what the vast majority of them want to see happen. “That’s what I want to see happen and I’m prepared to work with them to do that.” Professor Phil Banfield, the BMA’s chairman of council, called the offer “yet another pay cut in real terms and [it] serves only to increase the losses faced by doctors after more than a decade’s worth of sub-inflation pay awards.” Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the rise was fair: “It reflects the hugely important work that doctors do, and it’s an opportunity now for the NHS to move forward.” He denied the Government would make department cuts to fund the increases, saying the proposed immigration surcharge rise “better reflects the increased costs of providing NHS cover to those who come to the UK” and a “fair and reasonable approach”. He said the pay offer was final but added “My door is open to discuss other issues” with the BMA including working conditions in the NHS. Tory MP Steve Brine, the chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, paid credit to teaching unions “for recognising reality”.

The pact, similar to one signed with Albania in December, would speed up the process of sending back Turkish nationals who come to Britain illegally via the Channel. Turkey has been identified as a major hub for smuggling gangs and reports suggest many of the vessels used to cross the Channel are manufactured there. The agreement will see a new operations centre set up in Turkey by the country's national police, as well as faster exchange of customs data and other intelligence. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'We must do everything we can to smash the people-smuggling gangs and stop the boats.

Officials are said to be specifically targeting the network's supply chains and will try to seize items such as engines and life jackets which are vital to their tactics. A future returns agreement with Turkey could prove crucial amid rocketing numbers of Turkish nationals crossing the Channel by small boat. Newly published Home Office data showed Turks were the second largest nationality among Channel migrants making the crossing last month, with 370 people. In just four months – April to July – 1,359 Turkish nationals have arrived in Britain, compared with 1,076 in the previous 12 months.

The Prime Minister also used the meeting of the European Political Community to call for more support for Ukraine, backing Volodymyr Zelensky’s case for his war-torn nation to be part of Nato after talks with the Ukrainian president. Security for Ukraine and Moldova in the face of Moscow’s aggression dominated the summit held at a castle in the former Soviet republic, but Mr Sunak sought to put the issue of migration top of the agenda too. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “Whether it’s standing up to Russian aggression here in Moldova or in Ukraine, but also tackling illegal migration, are challenges that we can only really solve when we work together with other countries. “I’ve been having a series of very productive discussions here to strengthen everyone’s support for Ukraine, but also to work cooperatively to tackle illegal migration, which is one of my five big priorities.” Mr Sunak was expected to announce the start of negotiations on a new returns agreement with Moldova to allow the UK to send Moldovans found to be in violation of immigration law back to their home country. However, the value of such a pact would be disputable, as only one Moldovan was recorded by the Home Office as having arrived in the UK on a small boat this year. Only 17 were found to have arrived via unauthorised means between January 2018 and March this year, according to the department’s data. It comes as a similar deal with Georgia enters into force, and follows migration agreements with Albania and France. The Times reported that Britain would also target Turkey and Bulgaria as part of efforts to tackle small boats crossing the Channel, with the paper saying Border Force had evidence that Turkey had become a main hub for the manufacture of the dinghies used. Mr Sunak was also expected to announce an increase in bilateral intelligence-sharing with Bulgaria to crack down on criminal gangs involved in illegal migration. After talks with Mr Zelensky, who called for a decision on his country’s accession to Nato as he addressed the summit, the Prime Minister said that Ukraine’s “rightful place is in” the alliance.

However, more needs to be done to support the Albanian victims of people smuggling, especially women, the Home Affairs Select Committee said. In a report published on Monday focusing on Albania, the committee said there was no clear basis for the UK to accept thousands of asylum applications from Albanian citizens. It comes after migration data revealed more than a quarter of the 45,755 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2022 were Albanian, most of whom made an asylum claim. The number of Albanians making the channel crossing in small boats rose from 800 in 2021 to 12,301 last year. The UK should look at how access to work visa schemes can be improved to fill our skills or staffing gaps while offering Albanian nationals a route to higher income, benefiting both nations Dame Diana Johnson MP Labour chair of the committee Dame Diana Johnson MP said: “Such a substantial sudden increase in asylum claims from a seemingly peaceful country understandably raised concerns. More than a quarter of the 45,755 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats 2022 were Albanian (Gareth Fuller/PA) “While it is important that questions are asked and lessons are learnt, it is clear that the immigration picture is not static and will continue to evolve. “New challenges are likely to continue to emerge and it is important that the UK improves its overall approach to asylum, rather than focus on one country.” The committee said the main driver of migration from Albania was economic and recommended the Government promote seasonal work visas in agriculture and construction to give more Albanians the opportunity to come to the UK without making unauthorised channel crossings. The committee also said that while claims for political asylum “should not normally be entertained”, there are “unquestionably cases of Albanian citizens being trafficked to the UK”. It said appropriate safeguards must be in place before any victims of trafficking are returned to Albania and also recommended the UK maintain strong links with the country’s government. Dame Diana added: “Changes in migration will inevitably place strain on any system, but the Government must do much more to ensure it can better handle these stresses. “MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST IMPROVE THE SPEED OF DECISION-MAKING AND CLEAR THE BACKLOG AS WE SET OUT IN OUR CHANNEL CROSSINGS REPORT IN 2022. We expect the Home Office to set out how it plans to achieve this. “People will continue to be attracted to the UK from Albania while it continues to offer job opportunities and higher wages. “The UK should look at how access to work visa schemes can be improved to fill our skills or staffing gaps while offering Albanian nationals a route to higher income, benefiting both nations.”",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-12184037/No-clear-basis-accepting-Albanian-asylum-claims-cross-party-MPs-say.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-12184037/No-clear-basis-accepting-Albanian-asylum-claims-cross-party-MPs-say.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

This is after all the MP who has challenged Brexit protesters to fist fights, claimed that foodbank users “can’t cook”, and supports the death penalty, on the grounds that “nobody has ever committed a crime after being executed”. Anderson is what he is, his defenders are fond of saying. But what he is now starting to infect the rest of the Tory party. The response of Alex Chalk, an otherwise sensible MP, was particularly surprising. On LBC yesterday he said there was “nothing unreasonable in principle with what [Anderson] was saying… Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people”. Although his language was “salty”, he said “his indignation is well placed”. British voters are perfectly capable of telling between loudly trumpeted intentions and actual results Anderson’s language was disgraceful. Why wouldn’t Chalk at least condemn it in stronger terms? Why wouldn’t No 10? Although polls show the public is concerned about illegal immigration, there is no evidence it wants asylum seekers to be insulted and treated badly. Perhaps there is only one conclusion to draw: the Government is too timid to condemn Anderson’s outburst because it does not itself feel confident on the small boats issue. Anderson’s lowest common denominator guff is of course a cack-handed version of the populist’s “straight talk” — a brand of anti-rhetoric rhetoric. It is a gift to those who want to seem authentic, but as Donald Trump has demonstrated, it does not always go hand in hand with the truth. So with the Government’s policies on asylum seekers. The language is starting to drift ever further from the actual achievements. In fact the stronger the language, the weaker the position. It’s not just Anderson’s comments. This week is Stop the Boats Week — a phrase only rivalled by the Professional Enablers Taskforce, the Home Office’s name for a new group tasked with tracking down “Lefty lawyers” who want to help illegal immigrants. Yet for all the harsh and inflammatory language, little progress has been made. So far just 15 asylum seekers have boarded the Bibby Stockholm, the barge in Dorset which is supposedly set to accommodate some 500 migrants. The Home Office is now threatening a further 20 with withdrawal of their housing benefit. The hunt for “Lefty lawyers” turned up just five of them last year and seven in 2021. Meanwhile, the Rwanda scheme has been foundering since it began. Although it has now been ruled legal, there is little sign it will ever get up and running. As Conservative Home’s Henry Hill has pointed out, the answer to many of the Government’s problems with dealing with illegal immigration is to invest in infrastructure: a purpose-built detention centre, for example, would be one solution to the griping about putting asylum seekers up in hotels. Instead the Government seems to be pouring money into the production of expensive and unworkable signalling methods. It seems odd that the Conservatives would be stoking public feeling on immigration — pushing it up the agenda — when this is a subject on which they are weak. A recent poll from YouGov shows just nine per cent of the public have confidence the Government will reduce the number of small boats crossing the Channel. Just one per cent are “very confident”. This mirrors public trust in the Rwanda scheme ever producing results — three-quarters of voters think the plan is unlikely to go ahead. “AFTER THEIR ABJECT FAILURE,” SADIQ KHAN HAS SAID, “ALL THAT’S LEFT IS STOKING UP MORE DIVISION AND HATE.” BUT CREATING NOISE ABOUT IMMIGRATION DOESN’T COMPENSATE FOR FAILURE — IT EXPOSES IT. The risk in taking people like Anderson to represent British voters is that you underestimate them. They are perfectly capable of distinguishing between loudly trumpeted intentions and actual results. And there’s another group of potential voters the party seems to have forgotten about — not every Conservative voter is vehemently opposed to treating asylum seekers with empathy. In the past the party has taken care not to hack away at its more moderate voter base unnecessarily. Voters who support policies to assist those fleeing persecution will only be further turned off the Tory party.

She only managed to find a new place to live outside of Huddersfield yesterday - with just days to go before she starts her course on September 18. She added: 'It was a real rush. It’s not how I wanted to start the year. It’s shame. I just we would have been told a bit more about why our contracts were cancelled. We were left in the dark.’ Speaking about migrants taking over the tower block, she added: ‘I get why they’re doing this – they're doing it to better their lives. But it’s a real inconvenience for students. There have to be other places they can do this.' The situation outraged Labour MP for Huddersfield Barry Sheerman. He told MailOnline: 'It's a total mess. There was pressure at one stage back in the day for universities to recognise they were education experts but not residential experts. 'A lot of universities sold all their accommodation to the private sector... Because of that now what seems to have transpired is that these guys have said, ""oh this is nice, we get more money if we put asylum seekers in"". 'Quite ruthlessly, they have dumped students who have built all their hopes and plans on these rather nice residences they thought they were going to get.' The 18-year-old from Thirsk, North Yorkshire, had been planning for months to move into the 405-bed lavish halls, which has its own gym, cinema room and where top-end rooms can cost £200 a month to rent. Dozens of students now just have weeks to find new digs in Huddersfield after the bombshell news was dropped. The block includes its own cinema room To help with the house the new arrivals, the Home Office bought the HD1 block at Huddersfield, West Yorkshire - which comes with its own gym (pictured as an artist impression) and games room Plans to move hundreds of asylum seekers into a 405-bed HD1 tower in Huddersfield, which has a cinema room and gym and where top-end studio flats can cost £200 a week, have outraged Labour MP Barry Sheerman (pictured) Mr Sheerman said university vice chancellors were 'wringing their hands' about what had happened. 'Everybody is washing their hands and saying ''not my fault guv'',' he added. Mr Sheerman, who previously chaired the Commons Education Committee, said he had three grandchildren at university and young people were already enduring a 'really tough time' with high costs and the impact of Covid. 'The government has got to get a grip on this... the Office for Students isn't fit for purpose,' he said. Mr Sheerman said the Home Office had to be held responsible for taking the accommodation meant for students. 'We do have something called Cabinet government. Presumably the Home Secretary does speak to her colleagues in the education department,' he said. He added: 'I have deep sympathy for students being given an appalling deal by the system. 'At the end of the day the buck has to stop with the ministers responsible.' No students were living in the tower block prior to the arrangement having been reached. The HD1 student halls, only a short walk from the University of Huddersfield campus, in West Yorkshire, was previously advertised as 'luxury student accommodation'. Rooms were available to rent for from between £135 and £200 a week, with student facilities including a games room, pool table, cinema, gym and a washing room. More than 20,000 migrants arrived in the UK this year (pictured are migrants reaching the UK on Tuesday) The HD1 block has 405 beds - with 168 students who had reportedly signed on to live there having now been refunded (pictured is an example of a study area in one room) News of the deal comes after 300 migrants made the perilous Channel crossing in small boats on Tuesday - taking the total number of illegal arrivals reaching this UK this year to 20,000. Prestige Student Living (PSL), the lettings company, claimed landlord Hudd Student Management had told them the block would not be opening to students. The block had previously been unoccupied over the summer. So far, 168 students, due to be living in the halls, have now been refunded. In a statement, PSL told MailOnline: 'Hudd Student Management, the landlord for HD1, informed us that the building will not be opening to students in September. This decision is beyond the control of Prestige Student Living. 'Our team took immediate action to inform students and help them secure alternative accommodation in Huddersfield and return all payments made to us. 'We deeply sympathise with the students affected by the news and will do all we can to support them. 'Our agreement with the Hudd Student Management has terminated with immediate effect.' The news outraged Labour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock who told LBC students were 'paying the price for the Government's reliance on emergency accommodation'. Nick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, added he was 'genuinely shocked' by the news. Some of the boutique rooms boast having views of the canals in Huddersfield (pictured is an example of one of the bedrooms on offer) The halls are kitted out with their own kitchen and bathroom (pictured is an impression of the room, used of in official marketing material online) 'It's one thing for the Home Office to block-book an empty hall of residence that is brand new or empty but to let students down like this just before term starts seems pretty outrageous – especially when Huddersfield was identified earlier this week as an amber risk in terms of a shortage of student beds,' he told the Telegraph. He added the Home Office and landlords had a 'moral duty' to help the students but claimed that university accommodation is 'not generally taken as seriously in Whitehall' as other types of housing. A spokesman for Huddersfield University said: 'Huddersfield has sufficient student accommodation to meet the needs of our students and there are current vacancies available. For any students affected by this, who have not already been re-housed, please contact: hudlets@hud.ac.uk ' The Home Office said Britain was facing a huge demand from asylum seekers crossing the Channel. In a statement, a spokeswoman added: 'We have always been upfront about the unprecedented pressure being put on our asylum system, brought about by a significant increase in dangerous and illegal journeys into the country. 'We continue to work across government and with local authorities to identify a range of accommodation options. The government remains committed to engaging with local authorities and key stakeholders as part of this process.' Do you know one of the students affected at Huddersfield?

The rule of law depends upon lawyers representing their clients robustly and to the best of their ability. Lawyers are entitled – indeed obliged – to find any credible legal angle that gets the best result for their client. But they are not allowed to lie. Nor are they allowed to encourage others to lie. That's why this hugely important investigation by the Mail is extremely shocking. The alleged behaviour this paper's reporters have uncovered is not only appalling and irresponsible, but potentially criminal. It shows why it has been so hard for the Government to remove people with no right to be here – and why we were right to change the law to curb spurious challenges to removal. We know that the majority of lawyers are professional practitioners, but we also know there are some lawyers who are ideologically opposed to illegal-migration controls. They have said so, proudly. 'I spent several years as a barrister defending the Home Office, often against spurious claims from migrants,' writes Home Secretary Suella Braverman (pictured) Sir Keir Starmer (pictured) has even argued that there is a 'racist undercurrent' which 'permeates all immigration law' They've gone to town in using domestic law, international law and other conventions to prevent the removal of small-boat entrants and even foreigners convicted of heinous crimes including murder and rape. And they've been cheered on by the Government's political opponents. Indeed, Sir Keir Starmer has even argued that there is a 'racist undercurrent' which 'permeates all immigration law'. To howls of protest, we have changed the law – through the Nationality and Borders Act and the new Illegal Migration Act – to close loopholes, stop people exploiting modern slavery laws, make it easier to remove foreign criminals and deprive those who come here illegally of any right to stay. And the Labour Party has tried to block us at every turn. The British people want us to stop the boats and remove foreign criminals. They're right and should feel no shame. Time and again the public have proven how generous they are to Syrians, Afghans, Hong Kongers, Ukrainians and others who need refuge. HOWEVER, OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE BEING OVERWHELMED BY MIGRANTS WHO PAID PEOPLE-SMUGGLING GANGSTERS TO BRING THEM HERE FROM SAFE COUNTRIES SUCH AS FRANCE. Some 45,000 people arrived by small boats in the last year. The majority were adult males under the age of 40 and we are now spending more than £6million a day on hotels alone to house migrants in this country. Illegal migration makes us less safe, is unfair on taxpayers, supports organised crime, has led to thousands of people perishing needlessly at sea and disadvantaged the genuinely vulnerable who play by the rules. Nobody sane wants foreign rapists, paedophiles or murderers on our streets. Staff at solicitors’ firms readily agreed to help an undercover Mail reporter posing as an economic migrant get refugee status - despite being told he had no legitimate reason to stay in the UK after arriving on a small boat. VP Lingajothy (pictured) asked for £10,000 to invent a horrific back story to use in the asylum application Yet so-called progressives on the Left have utter contempt for public opinion and instead want to open our borders to any and everyone. I am shocked by what the Mail's brilliant journalists have uncovered, but I can't say I'm wholly surprised. I fear it may well be the tip of the iceberg. A good, honourable lawyer makes the most of the law. A dodgy lawyer will cheat and lie. That's why I am doing everything I can to work with our authorities to track down and punish any lawyers or firms found to be engaging in these kinds of practices. Either way, the law had to change. It contained too many loopholes for people to block or frustrate their removal. Now we have evidence that some lawyers would stop at nothing, including lying. I've been called a lot of ridiculous names for my tough stance. Well, every opponent of immigration controls should be eating their words today. I am very grateful to the Mail for showing why the Government, and the vast majority of the public, are on the right side when pushing for tougher action to stop the boats.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12337169/SUELLA-BRAVERMAN-trying-crack-people-smugglers-illegal-migrants-Labour-blocks-turn.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12337169/SUELLA-BRAVERMAN-trying-crack-people-smugglers-illegal-migrants-Labour-blocks-turn.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm. But Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the barge as “a sign of failure” by the Government, noting that 10,000 more asylum claimants have been moved into hotels since Rishi Sunak vowed to “stop the boats” coming across the Channel as one of five pledges the Prime Minister made in January. The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said. LABOUR WOULD END THE USE OF HOTELS AND BARGES, “GOING BACK TO THE LOW-COST, LONG-STANDING ASYLUM ACCOMMODATION OF WHICH WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY”. But pressed on Labour’s asylum policy answer if the party is returned to power, Ms Cooper said: “We don’t know what the scale of the chaos is going to be.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230811083055/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html

But he admitted that the Government has more to do to reduce the “vast expense” to taxpayers. The cost of the asylum system ballooned to £3.96billion from £2.11billion in a year as the total of migrants waiting for a decision rose to a record high. TORY MPS LAST NIGHT SAID THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS “NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE” AND URGED “ROOT AND BRANCH REFORM”. But the Prime Minister told the Daily Express: “The best way to relieve the unsustainable pressures on our asylum system and unacceptable costs to the taxpayer is to stop the boats in the first place. “That’s why we are focused on our plan to break the business model of the people smugglers facilitating these journeys, including working with international partners upstream to disrupt their efforts, stepping up joint work with the French to help reduce crossings and tackling the asylum backlog. READ MORE Figures show asylum seekers applying to UK highest in two decades Rishi Sunak urges to stop the boats “We’ve already reduced the legacy backlog by over 28,000 – nearly a third – since the start of December and we remain on track to meet our target. “But we know there is more to do to make sure asylum seekers do not spend months or years – living in the UK at vast expense to the taxpayer – waiting for a decision.” Mr Sunak added: “That’s why we’ve doubled the number of caseworkers over the last two years and continue to recruit more, and we are streamlining and modernising the end-to-end process with improved guidance, more focused interviews and rolling out the use of digital technology.” The Home Office spent £3.97billion on the asylum system in 2022/23, up from £2.12billion in a year. A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants. Some 175,457 people were waiting on an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June – up 44% from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since 1999.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. He added: “Small boats numbers are 15 percent down on last year, against a backdrop of rising numbers of illegal migrants elsewhere in Europe. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

I’m asking largely about healthy young people, albeit exhausted ones. Migrants, who have braved long, terrible journeys, often experiencing horrific violence and terror. So how many should we write off as justifiable collateral damage in our war against … what, exactly? There is no war except with ourselves: it’s a culture war. The cause is “strong borders”, but strong against what? Despite the rhetoric, this not an invasion. If the strong borders are to protect our economy – well, these are young, fit workers who could boost our economies if we actually let them work. The question of what number of deaths is acceptable is pertinent because we are actively pursuing policies that increase these avoidable deaths. So far this year, more than 2,000 people are estimated to have drowned in the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach European shores. About 650 people died when a single overcrowded boat sank off Greece in June. Just 104 were rescued. This month, 41 passengers died off the coast of Italy, 63 perished trying to reach Spain, and at least six people died in the Channel off the French coast, while trying to reach Britain in a small boat. The number of deaths rises as we normalise them. Will we reach a point of revulsion, where the public can no longer tolerate such tragedy, or will such a threshold rise with the deaths and the diminishment of our humanity? It is almost exactly eight years since the image of a drowned toddler washed up on a Mediterranean beach shocked the world into compassion. Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old, escaping war in Syria, had been attempting to reach Europe with his family when their small boat capsized on 2 September 2015. But the humane speeches from leaders proved a temporary reaction and, although the number of refugees seeking safety in Europe has fallen far below those at the height of the Syrian conflict, border policies have hardened and leaders have grown ever more hostile in speech and actions. We have allowed the political discussion around migration to be dominated by populist party sloganeering and driven by the sales agenda of tabloids with confected campaign stories. It has resulted in a swath of brutal and costly policies in Europe and north Africa, where people at their most vulnerable are tormented with impunity – and in no safe routes. In the UK, where mismanaged and delayed processing of asylum claims has created a backlog of more than 136,000 applicants who are forbidden to work, hotel housing costs are running at about £2.3bn a year. Thus riled by his government’s failures, Sunak has declared war on asylum seekers with a barrage of measures from the cruel to the unworkable to the ridiculous. These include last month’s drastic Illegal Migration Act, which torches the universal right of any human from anywhere to seek safety somewhere else on Earth (if that somewhere is Britain), and immigration minister Robert Jenrick’s petty removal of comforting cartoon murals at a detention centres holding traumatised children. ‘By the end of Sunak’s special week, the Bibby Stockholm’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated, owing to the risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease.’ Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images Sunak’s “small boats week” was not a community-awareness event marked by bake sales and fun runs in support of refugees and the RNLI. Instead, there was talk of sending migrants to Ascension Island, a remote rock in the middle of the Atlantic (even more ludicrous than the Rwanda plan), and the spectacle of a serving senior MP, a Conservative party deputy chair, telling asylum seekers to “fuck off back to France”. Meanwhile, the government pushed ahead with its plans to incarcerate a few hundred people – roughly 1% of those waiting for claim processing – on a densely packed barge off the south coast, despite expert warnings of fire and disease risk and, even more unforgivably, despite the discovery of legionella bacteria in water samples. By the end of Sunak’s special week, the barge’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated again, owing to the undeniably high risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease. This is performative politics, it is not leadership worthy of this nation, it is not governance fit for this time of true global crises. When will we look pragmatically at human movement and discuss a workable plan to manage it sustainably? The number of people moving across the world is only going to increase in coming decades, owing to population expansion and global warming, contributing to conflicts, disasters and food shortages that push people from their homes. By one estimate, there are more than 110 armed conflicts going on around the world and yet, in the UK, we receive a tiny proportion of asylum seekers per citizen compared with EU nations, let alone internationally. This is not an immigration crisis – but in the coming decades, it very much could be if we don’t plan today. THIS YEAR, WE’VE SEEN A TASTE OF THE CLIMATE CHAOS THAT WILL ONLY WORSEN, WITH FIRES, FLOODS, HURRICANES AND HEAT AFFECTING NATIONS ON EVERY CONTINENT DISPLACING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. In six years, some 2 billion people could be living in places where average temperatures exceed 29C; by the end of the century, this number approaches 4 billion. This summer, traumatised British refugees arriving in small boats from the wildfires in Rhodes were treated with kindness and generosity by Greek communities when they landed. They were lucky enough to have the papers (and skin colour) to receive asylum. It is in all of our interests to prevent a climate apartheid of safety on our shared planet. Even if we in the UK are not directly affected by extreme conditions, as holidaymakers or residents, we are, by extension, through our globalised human network. For instance, about half of our food is grown overseas, much of it in highly vulnerable areas, thus increasing prices. As conditions become too extreme, people will have to move. So too will capital, expertise, production, industry … everything will shift in response. The number is not fixed, and we still have plenty of choices. If we want fewer people to move, we need to fund places to adapt, and to rapidly speed our decarbonisation so the push factors aren’t worse. But inevitably people will move. We need an honest discussion about how we manage this movement, in our cities, nationally, and in collaboration with neighbouring nations – most of which are, like Britain, facing a shrinking labour force. This must be a moment of decision. Do we plan a workable way forward, adapting our border policies to accommodate the reality of this movement? Or do we decide that mass drownings of healthy young people are just fine?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars

Home Secretary Suella Braverman had previously said any migrants who arrived since March by 'irregular' routes – such as on dinghies across the Channel – would be barred from making asylum claims. But in a major concession to get the Government's Illegal Migration Bill through Parliament, it will now apply only to migrants who reach the UK after the legislation gains Royal Assent. Official figures show 9,622 migrants arrived on small boats between March 7 and Sunday. The Home Secretary's concession means they will now be able to claim asylum under existing rules – meaning many are likely to stay in Britain indefinitely. Official figures show 9,622 migrants arrived on small boats between March 7 and Sunday Mrs Braverman said: 'This Bill forms a crucial part of our action to stop the boats and ensure people do not risk their lives by making illegal and unnecessary journeys to the UK. Today's amendments will help this crucial legislation pass through Parliament swiftly, whilst continuing to send a clear message that the exploitation of children and vulnerable people, used by criminals and ferried across the Channel, cannot continue.' The Government's Bill suffered 20 defeats in the House of Lords as peers sought to water down its measures. It now faces a tortuous series of votes in the Commons as the Government seeks to erase peers' changes. If it passes the 'ping-pong' stage between the two Houses today and tomorrow, the Bill could gain Royal Assent – and become law – within days. IN A FURTHER SOP TO THE LORDS, MRS BRAVERMAN TABLED FURTHER AMENDMENTS WHICH WILL INCREASE SAFEGUARDS AROUND THE DETENTION OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILD MIGRANTS. If a child is detained for removal from Britain, an immigration judge will be able to grant bail after eight days instead of the previous proposal of 28 days. In a further concession, the Home Office will be able to detain pregnant women for a maximum of 72 hours, extendable to seven days on a ministers' authorisation. Migrants who arrived since March 7 will still face bans on re-entering the UK and will be excluded from gaining settlement or citizenship in this country. Migrants who arrived since March 7 will still face bans on re-entering the UK and will be excluded from gaining settlement or citizenship in this country The Home Office confirmed that 269 migrants reached Britain across the Channel on Sunday, bringing the total so far this year to 12,772, compared with 13,286 at the same point last year. It came as former home secretary and chancellor Ken Clarke said the Rwanda deal – which will see migrants sent to claim asylum in the east African nation rather than here – is the only way to stop small-boat crossings. 'We can no longer simply do nothing. We must give the Rwanda scheme a chance to work,' Lord Clarke, who is on the liberal wing of the Tory party, wrote in The Daily Telegraph.  A man wanted in connection with a tragedy which saw 27 migrants drown in the Channel in 2021 has been extradited to France.

All residents and staff were moved off the vessel in Portland Port on Friday, four days after tests of its water system raised the alarm – on the same day the first migrants moved in. RISHI SUNAK HAS COMMITTED TO PUTTING PEOPLE BACK ON THE BARGE, AND USING OTHERS, AS PART OF HIS PLANS FOR “ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION” TO CUT THE £6M-A-DAY COST OF ASYLUM HOTELS. On Tuesday, health minister Will Quince said the government hoped the Bibby Stockholm would be occupied again “in the next few days”, calling potentially fatal Legionella “a teething issue”. But The Independent understands that it will take weeks for the required work to be carried out, with the barge’s water system being completely “flushed” and retested. Official guidance from the Health and Safety Executive states that where high levels of Legionella are found: “The system should be resampled and an immediate review of the control measures and risk assessment carried out to identify any remedial actions, including possible disinfection of the system. “Retesting should take place a few days after disinfection and at frequent intervals afterwards until a satisfactory level of control is achieved.” Costs are rising as the removed asylum seekers remain under health supervision in a hotel, where some have been told they will remain for up to five weeks. Questions over why people were moved onto the Bibby Stockholm before test results for Legionella were received following water sampling on 25 July have not been addressed. The Home Office and its contractors have refused to answer The Independent’s questions on why residents were not given any safety advice regarding the water, and had not been informed of the issue at the point media statements were released on Friday. Dorset Council said test results were given to government contractors Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Landry and Kling on 7 August – when the first migrants were moved on board. It said a Home Office official was “verbally informed” of the Legionella test results at a meeting on 8 August, but Downing Street has claimed that ministers were not made aware at that point. The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge remains empty at Portland Port in Dorset (James Manning/PA) (PA Wire) An “incident management meeting” on Thursday concluded that no one else would be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm while a risk assessment was carried out, and the Home Office then decided to move all 39 asylum seekers off the barge. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “Every new revelation about this scandal raises further questions about how much the government knew about the risk or actual presence of Legionella when they chose to press ahead with sending asylum-seekers on to that barge. “It’s clear that ministers were so focused on getting people on to the barge during their catastrophic ‘Small Boats Week’ that they cut corners.” The prime minister has continued to argue that the vessel and military bases are a cheaper solution to housing asylum seekers than hotels, despite a series of setbacks including tuberculosis cases at RAF Wethersfield and delays for safety checks at RAF Scampton. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak swerved a question about whether he was personally warned about potential health risks for asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm, telling journalists: “What has happened here is it is right that we go through all the checks and procedures to ensure the wellbeing and health of the people being housed on the barge.” He said he remained “committed” to the barge and to “stopping the boats”, although numbers are climbing in calm weather. The government hopes to house up to 500 men on the controversial barge, which had already been hit by a succession of delays and safety concerns. Inside the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge Only 15 of the 50 people originally planned to board moved on last Monday, following a wave of legal letters challenging transfer notices over mental and physical health issues. The Home Office dropped attempts to move more than 20 people who contested being moved on board, but threatened other asylum seekers with the withdrawal of housing and financial support. Most of those selected for the barge were not small boat migrants, and claimed asylum after flying to the UK legally, The Independent revealed. Charity Care4Calais, which supports migrants, said ministers should now realise that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable”. Chief executive Steve Smith added: “We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. “The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. “The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. All asylum seekers accommodated on the Bibby Stockholm have been disembarked as a precaution and moved to alternative accommodation. “The Home Office and our contractors are following all protocol and advice from Dorset Council’s Environmental Health team, UK Health Security Agency and Dorset NHS who we are working closely with.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240225050932/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bibby-stockholm-barge-legionella-bacteria-b2394036.html

She has worked as a science writer, television presenter, journalist, editing staff, writer.'}]","What’s an acceptable number of dead people in European waters? What about dead children? I’m asking largely about healthy young people, albeit exhausted ones. Migrants, who have braved long, terrible journeys, often experiencing horrific violence and terror. So how many should we write off as justifiable collateral damage in our war against … what, exactly? There is no war except with ourselves: it’s a culture war. The cause is “strong borders”, but strong against what? Despite the rhetoric, this not an invasion. If the strong borders are to protect our economy – well, these are young, fit workers who could boost our economies if we actually let them work. The question of what number of deaths is acceptable is pertinent because we are actively pursuing policies that increase these avoidable deaths. SO FAR THIS YEAR, MORE THAN 2,000 PEOPLE ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE DROWNED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO REACH EUROPEAN SHORES. About 650 people died when a single overcrowded boat sank off Greece in June. Just 104 were rescued. This month, 41 passengers died off the coast of Italy, 63 perished trying to reach Spain, and at least six people died in the Channel off the French coast, while trying to reach Britain in a small boat. The number of deaths rises as we normalise them. Will we reach a point of revulsion, where the public can no longer tolerate such tragedy, or will such a threshold rise with the deaths and the diminishment of our humanity? It is almost exactly eight years since the image of a drowned toddler washed up on a Mediterranean beach shocked the world into compassion. Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old, escaping war in Syria, had been attempting to reach Europe with his family when their small boat capsized on 2 September 2015. But the humane speeches from leaders proved a temporary reaction and, although the number of refugees seeking safety in Europe has fallen far below those at the height of the Syrian conflict, border policies have hardened and leaders have grown ever more hostile in speech and actions. We have allowed the political discussion around migration to be dominated by populist party sloganeering and driven by the sales agenda of tabloids with confected campaign stories. It has resulted in a swath of brutal and costly policies in Europe and north Africa, where people at their most vulnerable are tormented with impunity – and in no safe routes. In the UK, where mismanaged and delayed processing of asylum claims has created a backlog of more than 136,000 applicants who are forbidden to work, hotel housing costs are running at about £2.3bn a year. Thus riled by his government’s failures, Sunak has declared war on asylum seekers with a barrage of measures from the cruel to the unworkable to the ridiculous. These include last month’s drastic Illegal Migration Act, which torches the universal right of any human from anywhere to seek safety somewhere else on Earth (if that somewhere is Britain), and immigration minister Robert Jenrick’s petty removal of comforting cartoon murals at a detention centres holding traumatised children. ‘By the end of Sunak’s special week, the Bibby Stockholm’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated, owing to the risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease.’ Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images Sunak’s “small boats week” was not a community-awareness event marked by bake sales and fun runs in support of refugees and the RNLI. Instead, there was talk of sending migrants to Ascension Island, a remote rock in the middle of the Atlantic (even more ludicrous than the Rwanda plan), and the spectacle of a serving senior MP, a Conservative party deputy chair, telling asylum seekers to “fuck off back to France”. Meanwhile, the government pushed ahead with its plans to incarcerate a few hundred people – roughly 1% of those waiting for claim processing – on a densely packed barge off the south coast, despite expert warnings of fire and disease risk and, even more unforgivably, despite the discovery of legionella bacteria in water samples. By the end of Sunak’s special week, the barge’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated again, owing to the undeniably high risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease. This is performative politics, it is not leadership worthy of this nation, it is not governance fit for this time of true global crises. When will we look pragmatically at human movement and discuss a workable plan to manage it sustainably? The number of people moving across the world is only going to increase in coming decades, owing to population expansion and global warming, contributing to conflicts, disasters and food shortages that push people from their homes. By one estimate, there are more than 110 armed conflicts going on around the world and yet, in the UK, we receive a tiny proportion of asylum seekers per citizen compared with EU nations, let alone internationally. This is not an immigration crisis – but in the coming decades, it very much could be if we don’t plan today. This year, we’ve seen a taste of the climate chaos that will only worsen, with fires, floods, hurricanes and heat affecting nations on every continent displacing millions of people. In six years, some 2 billion people could be living in places where average temperatures exceed 29C; by the end of the century, this number approaches 4 billion. This summer, traumatised British refugees arriving in small boats from the wildfires in Rhodes were treated with kindness and generosity by Greek communities when they landed. They were lucky enough to have the papers (and skin colour) to receive asylum. It is in all of our interests to prevent a climate apartheid of safety on our shared planet. Even if we in the UK are not directly affected by extreme conditions, as holidaymakers or residents, we are, by extension, through our globalised human network. For instance, about half of our food is grown overseas, much of it in highly vulnerable areas, thus increasing prices. As conditions become too extreme, people will have to move. So too will capital, expertise, production, industry … everything will shift in response. The number is not fixed, and we still have plenty of choices. If we want fewer people to move, we need to fund places to adapt, and to rapidly speed our decarbonisation so the push factors aren’t worse. But inevitably people will move. We need an honest discussion about how we manage this movement, in our cities, nationally, and in collaboration with neighbouring nations – most of which are, like Britain, facing a shrinking labour force. This must be a moment of decision. Do we plan a workable way forward, adapting our border policies to accommodate the reality of this movement? Or do we decide that mass drownings of healthy young people are just fine?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars

Jenrick also deflected questions on Sunday about how many people had been removed from the UK under a “gold standard” UK-Albanian deal, which targets people arriving illegally from Albania mainly by crossing the Channel. He said hundreds of people had been removed but that others were still being housed in hotels or had absconded. Jenrick told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday show it was still “early days” under the deal and that “spurious last minute claims” had held up deportations. The deal with the Albanian authorities had been lauded by Rishi Sunak as the prime minister came under pressure from the right of the Tory party after figures showed more than a third of people who arrived on small boats in the UK via the Channel in the first nine months of 2022 were from Albania. While Jenrick initially said thousands had been removed to Albania, he went on to qualify this by saying: “There are hundreds of Albanians who’ve arrived on small boats who have been placed on those flights as a result of the processes we put in place and the agreements that we’ve reached with Albania.” The government is under renewed pressure from its own backbenches after figures published last month showed net immigration to the UK had increased from 488,000 in 2021 to 606,000 in 2022. The figure for last year is nearly double the number in 2018. Jenrick told the BBC that net immigration was “far too high today”. But when asked about a pledge under David Cameron to limit immigration to “tens of thousands” of people a year, Jenrick said: “I don’t think that targets like that are particularly helpful because migration is an extremely challenging space where behaviours are constantly changing.” He said a lot of progress had been made on illegal immigration in a short period of time, with “really unique landmark deals” with France resulting in a “big increase” in the number of interceptions on the beaches. But Jenrick said the asylum system, which, according to him had a backlog of more than 150,000 cases, must be changed “fundamentally”. He said the illegal migration bill would alleviate the pressure. The government’s asylum bill – which is supposed to change the law so that those who arrive in the UK by irregular means can be removed to a third country such as Rwanda – goes before the House of Lords this week. It is expected to face significant opposition from peers and could be amended or delayed until later in the year. Defending the government’s record during a round of broadcast interviews on Sunday, Jenrick said a lot of progress had been made on illegal immigration in a short period of time. But he told the BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “The asylum system is riddled with abuse, we have to be honest with ourselves.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guardian Headlines UK Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Westminster city council’s leader wrote to the home secretary, Suella Braverman, to express “deep concern” that about 40 refugees had been placed in the borough on Wednesday night “without appropriate accommodation or support available … and no prior communication with the local authority”. Jenrick said: “As I understand what happened here was that these migrants, who had themselves said that they were destitute, they had nowhere to stay, we had offered them a safe bed with board and lodgings in a good-quality hotel in central London. “YES, SOME OF THEM HAD TO SHARE WITH OTHER PEOPLE. These are single adult males: I don’t think that’s unreasonable,” he said, adding that the government wanted to reduce the cost to the taxpayer. Jenrick denied it was government policy to tell asylum seekers they had to share four to a room in hotels, but said it was “completely fair and reasonable” to ask single adult males to share a room.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/04/uk-asylum-system-immigration-reduction-targets-albania,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/04/uk-asylum-system-immigration-reduction-targets-albania

She has worked as a politician and has held the position of member of the 58th Parliament of the United Kingdom affiliated with the Conservative Party.'}]","M Ps who came up with a blueprint for reducing the number of migrants arriving lawfully into the UK have insisted they are loyal to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “BUT HE IS VERY MUCH PART OF OUR GROUP, VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AND SAID SO PUBLICLY, SO HE IS VERY MUCH ON BOARD WITH WHAT WE ARE DOING.” MIRIAM CATES, THE MP FOR PENISTONE AND STOCKSBRIDGE, SAID ONLY WHEN THE SUPPLY OF CHEAP LABOUR WAS SCALED BACK WOULD BRITONS BE ABLE TO GAIN BETTER SKILLS. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” Ms Cates questioned the decision to keep care workers on the occupation shortage list, a designation that allows the sector to bring lower-skilled workers into the country to fill positions, suggesting it was a Covid policy that had not delivered. She said the country had “record levels of migration, and we’ve still not solved the care crisis”, with Ms Cates instead arguing that the solution was to “train up our own people to do the work” and “improve the pay conditions so that people want to do it”. Mr Kruger said the group, along with his party, were rallying against the “establishment” when it came to migration reforms. “There is an establishment in this country, which the Conservative leadership and our colleagues here are not part of, and that is the establishment that we’re fighting against, that resists these proposals, particularly on immigration,” he said. Downing Street said the Government had no plan to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list and downplayed the prospect of blocking foreign university students from staying in the UK after graduation – another recommendation made by the New Conservatives group. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to say whether Mr Sunak was frustrated by Mr Anderson’s support for tougher migration rules but acknowledged there were “different views on each side”. Home Secretary Suella Braverman faced a question from Tory MP James Daly in the Commons about raising the main skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 per annum, a recommendation made in Mr Hunt’s report. Mrs Braverman told him she recognised that “net migration is too high” and that overall numbers needed to be reduced. She earlier told MPs: “We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-danny-kruger-lee-anderson-b1091832.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-danny-kruger-lee-anderson-b1091832.html

But for Rishi Sunak, these are not normal times. The presence of Lee Anderson among the New Conservatives, a pressure group of predominantly “red wall”-based 2019- and 2017-intake Tory MPs, is just one of the eyebrow-raising elements of their decision to intervene on migration. The group held a formal launch on Monday for its 12-point plan to cut immigration – policies which, if implemented, would have a fairly dramatic impact on not just immigration but the economy more widely. THE STATED AMBITION IS TO REDUCE ANNUAL NET MIGRATION FROM 2022’S 606,000 TO 240,000 IN 2024, INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO VISAS FOR CARE STAFF, FURTHER CURBS ON STUDENT VISAS, A BIG RISE IN THE MINIMUM SALARY THRESHOLD FOR SKILLED WORKERS AND A CAP ON REFUGEE NUMBERS. It was devised by a group including Anderson, the combative Ashfield MP who Sunak made Tory deputy chair in February – although he dropped out of appearing at the launch event. The emergence of the plan raises a series of interlinked questions, including what it says about the renewed salience of immigration as a political issue, and the authority of Sunak – plus of course whether the proposals are even realistic. The return of migration as a concern for restive backbenchers marks a change from the immediate post-Brexit period, when the proportion of voters who named it as among their most pressing issues dropped as low as 15%. This is now back up to 35%, rising to nearly 60% among Tory voters, caused by both the increase in net migration, and people including Nigel Farage prompting a political panic about refugees making Channel crossings. Grumbles about immigration are not a exactly new thing for Tory prime ministers, but the emergence of such a concerted and notably detailed parallel policy will be seen as another sign that while Sunak is not at risk of an open challenge by his party, neither is he really in charge of it. With the Conservatives consistently up to 20 or more percentage points behind Labour, it is perhaps of little surprise that some of Sunak’s MPs – notably those in vulnerable red wall seats – want drastic action. In pure party management terms, even if the New Conservatives could muster their claimed 25-strong number, this is unlikely to trouble Sunak in the Commons. But at the same time, functional political parties do not generally propose two simultaneous immigration policies. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is nonetheless fair to say that plenty of other Conservative MPs would worry about the wisdom of trying to implement such massive reductions so fast, especially in a care sector already struggling to fill vacancies. Asked about the practicalities of the plan, Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge – another leading figure in the New Conservatives – told BBC Radio 4 that ministers should “make care work an attractive career for British people” and invest more in skills, infrastructure and productivity. That is not a new argument – in fact it is one already made in very similar terms by Labour. Nevertheless, it is usually phrased as a long-term aspiration, not something to be done in little more than a year. It was notable that when Cates was asked what sort of hourly rate might be needed to attract UK nationals to care work, she replied: “I don’t know.” With such basic questions unanswered, it is probably fair to say that the New Conservatives will not get their way on immigration policy. But for an increasingly beleaguered Sunak, it is yet another split he could really do without.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/03/new-conservatives-immigration-questions-over-sunak-authority,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/03/new-conservatives-immigration-questions-over-sunak-authority

THE OLDEST ASYLUM SEEKER YET DISCOVERED PRETENDING TO BE A CHILD WAS ACTUALLY FOUND TO BE 41, ROBERT JENRICK SAID. He told MPs that medical assessments - thought to include X-rays or MRI scans - will initially run in parallel with existing tests which are based on behavioural and language studies. ‘That will happen over the course of this year,’ Mr Jenrick told MPs in the Commons. ‘The oldest individual that we’ve encountered who posed as a child was subsequently found to be 41 years of age. ‘We do take the issue of age assessment extremely seriously. Scientific age assessments of migrants who claim to be children will start this year, the immigration minister Robert Jenrick confirmed today Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai (pictured) who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year ‘There are individuals who abuse the system - that’s wrong as a matter of principle but it’s also a serious safeguarding risk to genuine children. ‘It’s important that we weed out those cases of abuse because it poses such a risk. ‘I’m afraid we’ve seen some very tragic instances such as the murder that occurred in Bournemouth at the behest of somebody who had posed as a child.’ Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year. Abdulrahimzai was on the run from murder charges in Serbia when he arrived in Britain, and was later convicted in his absence of gunning down two people with a Kalashnikov assault rifle. The Home Office commissioned a report, published in January, which said migrants suspected of pretending to be children could undergo a range of medical tests to determine their true age. It recommended a combination of X-rays of the wisdom teeth and the hand or wrist, plus MRI scans of the knee or collarbone. The move may prove controversial because medics have opposed the use of X-rays for non-medical reasons. Other shocking cases in which adult asylum seekers claimed to be children include Ahmad Otak who in 2012 forced his ex-girlfriend to watch him murder her sister and her friend after she refused to take him back. Mr Roberts was murdered by Abdulrahimzai following an argument over a scooter in Bournemouth A court heard the Afghan lied about his age to get preferential treatment from social services, but Otak was actually 22. Others include Parson’s Green terrorist Ahmed Hassan, who posed as a 16-year-old before setting off a bomb on a Tube train in west London in 2017, injuring 23 people. A judge said he was satisfied the bomber was between 18 and 21. Other adult migrants have ended up in schools being taught alongside young teenage children. Migrants who claim to be under 18 receive better housing and support, a more sympathetic hearing in their asylum claim and are less likely to be detained. Under current rules, local authorities are not allowed to carry out physical examinations of asylum seekers suspected of lying about their age. Instead, social workers estimate the person’s age by assessing their behaviour and language skills. In 2021 the British Dental Association said it ‘vigorously opposed’ using dental X-rays to establish asylum seekers’ ages.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

In a letter to her successor Suella Braverman, Dame Priti said there had been an “alarming and staggering” lack of clarity about the plans for the former RAF base at Wethersfield in Essex. The site has been earmarked to house 1,700 asylum seekers by the autumn as part of Government plans to reduce the money spent on hotels. DAME PRITI, WHOSE WITHAM CONSTITUENCY IS NEAR THE AIRFIELD, HIT OUT AFTER REPORTS THE SITE COULD BE IN USE FOR FIVE YEARS. The first asylum seekers moved into the site in July. In her letter to Mrs Braverman and immigration minister Robert Jenrick, Dame Priti said she had asked a series of parliamentary questions but had received “no definitive answer”. “It is therefore concerning to now see that it appears that the Home Office has put in place plans to use the site for asylum accommodation for a five-year period and considers that this meets the value for money requirement,” she said. Dame Priti said the failure to provide a direct answer “gives the impression that the Home Office is being evasive”. The possibility of the site being used for five years to achieve value for money emerged in a leaked memo reported by the Daily Telegraph. Dame Priti suggested the Government was being “secretive about its intentions”. She told Mrs Braverman: “Clear answers now need to be provided by the Home Office and the Government must be transparent rather than evasive. “The lack of clarity has been alarming and staggering and I trust you will resolve this urgently.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/priti-patel-home-office-suella-braverman-robert-jenrick-raf-b2392781.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230815022708/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/priti-patel-home-office-suella-braverman-robert-jenrick-raf-b2392781.html

There were a total of 78,768 applications relating to 97,390 people in the year ending June 2023 - 19 per cent more than the previous year. Albania was the most common nationality applying for asylum in Britain, with 11,790 applications - 7,557 of which came from arrivals on boats crossing the Channel. Afghans were the second most common nationality, with 9,964 applications - almost double the number in the previous 12 months (5,154). More than 19,000 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year, with 345 people making the crossing on Wednesday. Today's immigration statistics revealed that the backlog of asylum cases has hit a new record high. A group of migrants are brought ashore at Dover today, as new figures showed the number of asylum applications to the UK has hit the highest level in two decades More than 18,000 people have now crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year. Pictured are people arriving this morning A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June 2023, up 44% from 122,213 at the end of June 2022 - the highest figure since current records began in 2010. The number of asylum seekers waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57% year on year from 89,231 and another record. The rise was 'due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions', the Home Office said. However, the number of cases waiting for a decision has risen by less than 1% in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the increase is slowing down. 'This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,' the Home Office added. There were 23,702 initial decisions made on asylum applications in the UK in the year to June 2023, up 61% on 14,730 in the year to June 2022.

Just over seven in 10 (71%) of initial decisions on asylum applications in the year to June 2023 were grants of refugee status, humanitarian protection or alternative forms of leave. This is 'substantially higher' than in pre-pandemic years, when around a third of initial decisions were grants, the Home Office said. The grant rate has been above 70% since 2021. Before then, the previous high was in 1990, when it stood at 82%, although the volume of applications was much lower at that time. STEPHEN KINNOCK, LABOUR’S SHADOW IMMIGRATION MINISTER, SAID: “THESE NEW STATISTICS SET OUT IN STARK TERMS THE COMPLETE CHAOS THE TORIES HAVE CREATED IN THE IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM SYSTEM. “The asylum backlog has reached a new record high, with 175,000 people now waiting for decisions. 'Only one per cent of last year's 45,000 small boats cases have received a decision and the number of failed asylum seekers being returned is also down a whopping 70 per cent since 2010. This is a disastrous record for the Prime Minister and Home Secretary. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day.' The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the high backlog could push more asylum seekers into the 'underground' jobs market. Rachel Goodall, from Refugee Action, said: 'The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the Government's hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives. 'It has forced thousands of people into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and MoD sites from which only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit.' Home Office spending on asylum in the UK in 2022/23 stood at £3.97 billion, nearly double the £2.12 billion in 2021/22, government figures show. A decade ago, in 2012/13, the total stood at £500.2 million. Border Force officials escort 50 migrants to Dover docks after they arrived this morning Rishi Sunak - seen on a visit to a school in Yorkshire on Monday - has pledged to end cross-Channel crossings. The chance of this vow being achieved seems remote The IPPR has previously warned that the cost of housing illegal immigrants could almost triple to more than £6billion a year within five years without a rapid increase in the rate at which cases are dealt with and they are deported. In a report released this week, the think-tank said Government plans to tackle unauthorised migration into the UK could become mired in a 'perma-backlog' where the pace of arrivals exceeds that of departures. The Illegal Migration Act, central to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to 'stop the boats' crossing the Channel, means asylum claims of people who come to the UK illegally will not be considered and they face deportation to their home country or to a 'safe' third nation such as Rwanda. But flights destined for the east African country have yet to take off, with the policy currently awaiting an appeal decision in the courts, and there are no similar agreements with other countries. The IPPR said that even if the Rwanda deal is ruled lawful, deportations are likely to be on a small scale, meaning arrivals will continue to outpace removals. Blocked from working, they could remain reliant on costly long-term Government support and housing. IPPR researchers estimated that accommodation costs could exceed £6 billion a year after five years in the worst case scenario where only 50 people are removed to third countries each month. Even with a higher rate of removals the cost would be more than £5billion, it claims. Home Office figures show the UK is currently spending £2.3billion on accommodation. Today's immigration statistics also revealed a 45% increase in the number of work visas to 321,101. This was mainly driven by an increase in the 'Skilled Worker' visas for people working in health and social care, where there have been severe worker shortages. It comes as the former head of Border Force said cross-Channel migrants were resisting rescue until they reached British waters. Tony Smith told Today on BBC Radio 4: 'Those on board are not seeking rescue, because... then they'll be taken back to France. 'So there is evidence that people are resisting rescue until such a time as they reach our waters and of course we are duty bound - Border Force is duty bound - to rescue them. 'Once they're on board a British vessel they will claim asylum and that's been the business model for some time now.' Mr Smith said the Channel crisis would continue as long as the French authorities continued to 'interpret international law' in a way that means they do not intercept vessels unless those on board are in danger. He added: 'I hear stories of tactics where vulnerable people are being held over the side of vessels with a threat that, ''We will scupper ourselves if you come near.'' New immigration statistics published today showed there were 321,101 grants to main applicants on work visas in the year ending June 2023. That was 45% higher than the previous year Mr Smith said this meant that the French had decided to escort the boats until they got to the UK. He called for a new agreement with France or the EU to create joint patrols that would take migrants back to Calais. 'There is provision in international law to do that, where two countries could collaborate on joint patrols, we could have our people on their vessels and vice versa,' he said. 'But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais. 'And then of course they wouldn't get into the UK asylum system. That's where the blockage has been. 'The French position is that this is an EU- wide issue.'

Robert Jenrick said more will embark on the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm in the coming days after an initial batch of 15 on Monday - when up to 20 people refused and filed legal challenges. The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm.

Labour would end the use of hotels and barges, “going back to the low-cost, long-standing asylum accommodation of which we have tens of thousands of places in this country”.

Now the law will be changed to dramatically hike fines from the start of next year. The civil penalty for employers, which was last increased in 2014, will be raised to up to £45,000 per illegal worker for a first breach from £15,000, and up to £60,000 for repeat breaches from £20,000. For landlords the fines will increase from £80 per illegal lodger and £1,000 per occupier for a first breach to up to £5,000 per lodger and £10,000 per occupier. Repeat breaches will be up to £10,000 per lodger and £20,000 per occupier, up from £500 and £3,000 respectively. The Home Office said last night that ""illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel"" and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent.

THE SENIOR CONSERVATIVE MP HAS BACKED A REPORT FROM THINKTANK POLICY EXCHANGE WHICH CLAIMS THAT THE “GALVANISATION OF VOLUNTARY SPIRIT” IN A UKRAINE-STYLE SPONSORSHIP SCHEME COULD CUT IMMIGRATION HOUSING COSTS. In a forward, Mr Lewis wrote: “We must do more to galvanise community efforts, such as by expanding the sponsorship model for Ukrainian refugees to other nationalities – so that the burden of supporting refugees is spread evenly, rather than falling on the poorest.” Policy Exchange says that the current system is “not only too expensive but also too statist”, calling Britons to put their money where their mouth is and stop housing migrants in hotels and barges in poorer areas. It adds: “The key to better sharing the load with wealthier parts of ‘progressive liberal Britain’ – relatively pro-refugee areas which tend to have higher housing costs – is galvanising voluntary spirit.” It also urged the Government to prioritise women and children refugees.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1790230/migrant-crisis-housing-brandon-lewis-poll-spt,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1790230/migrant-crisis-housing-brandon-lewis-poll-spt

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. IPSWICH MP TOM HUNT SAID LEVELS OF MIGRATION WERE “TOO HIGH” AND “UNSUSTAINABLE”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable.

His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills.

She said the country had “record levels of migration, and we’ve still not solved the care crisis”, with Ms Cates instead arguing that the solution was to “train up our own people to do the work” and “improve the pay conditions so that people want to do it”. Mr Kruger said the group, along with his party, were rallying against the “establishment” when it came to migration reforms. “There is an establishment in this country, which the Conservative leadership and our colleagues here are not part of, and that is the establishment that we’re fighting against, that resists these proposals, particularly on immigration,” he said. Downing Street said the Government had no plan to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list and downplayed the prospect of blocking foreign university students from staying in the UK after graduation – another recommendation made by the New Conservatives group. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to say whether Mr Sunak was frustrated by Mr Anderson’s support for tougher migration rules but acknowledged there were “different views on each side”.

The Labour politician said it was 'reasonable' for people to 'resent' the idea that it was possible to circumvent the system if you are 'young, able bodied' and with enough money to pay a people smuggler. SIR TREVOR, WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS HEAD OF THE COMMISSION FOR RACIAL EQUALITY, SAID MOST PEOPLE FROM A MIGRANT BACKGROUND TOOK THIS VIEW BECAUSE THEY HAD PERSONALLY FOLLOWED THE RULES. He warned against treating all immigrants as if they were a 'single mass' and said not enough effort was being put into identifying those who were in the country illegally. 'We've got to find who the illegal immigrants are – we're now talking about upwards of a million people – very little effort is going into that, because actually, it benefits quite a lot of people,' Sir Trevor told the Telegraph. Sir Trevor Phillips said it was 'reasonable' for people to 'resent' the idea that it was possible to circumvent the system if you are 'young, able bodied' and with enough money to pay a people smuggler 'Secondly, once you have found illegal immigrants, they should be treated fairly. Most people of a migrant background will take that view because most of us did it the hard way. 'The aunt who brought me up in British Guiana, who, equal to my parents, is the most important person to me in the world, could not come to my marriage, because we weren't going to cheat the system and get her here by some dodgy means.' Sir Trevor, who is the youngest of ten children, was born in London to a railway worker father and seamstress mother who had emigrated from Guiana in 1950 - two years before the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush. He is now hosting his own current affairs show, Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, which launches on Sky at 8.30am on September 3. Sir Trevor, previously served as chair of the London Assembly, also stressed the importance of people from different ethnic groups mixing with each other rather than living in separate communities. He questioned whether the British model of multiculturalism was working when in some towns and cities people would mix together at work but in the evenings go back to areas 'in which everybody who lives there are people like themselves'. He listed Burney, Preston and Leicester and some towns in the North West as examples of this phenomenon. The number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the Channel recently topped 20,000. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has said the Conservative government has 'failed to get a grip' on Channel crossings.

Pictured are migrants arriving at Dover But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has continued to defend his 'stop the boats' plan as he faced questions from broadcasters and insisted the Government was making progress. The Home Office recently announced that cross-Channel migrants could be forced to wear electronic tags.

Any attempt to remove the tag and abscond would result in any right to bail or to remain in the UK being automatically withdrawn.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. THERE ARE REASONS TO DOUBT THAT SUNAK’S MORALLY DEBASED CAMPAIGN WILL SUCCEED: ATTITUDES TOWARDS IMMIGRATION HAVE IMPROVED, WITH ONLY 9% OF VOTERS REGARDING REDUCING IT AS A TOP PRIORITY, AND THE COUNTRY’S CRISES ARE TOO CALAMITOUS TO SHIFT THE BLAME FROM THE RULING PARTY. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration

It’s interventionist. It’s treading on the territory of national sovereignty.” She accused a “range of forces” including left-wing campaigners and lawyers intent on thwarting the Government’s pledge to stop the boats. And she blasted Labour for actively wanting to “facilitate illegal migration”.

Figures obtained by The Independent show more than 11,000 people who are currently waiting for relocation are stranded abroad while being failed by one of the government’s only “safe and legal routes” to the UK. The majority are women and children, in countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iran. In all the cases, one of their close family members has already been granted protection in the UK and has the right to bring their partners and children to join them. One Sudanese refugee told The Independent he has been waiting for almost a year for a visa for his wife and son, who are stranded amid a raging conflict that has already claimed his nephew’s life. In another shocking incident, one girl was “followed home from school and raped” by Iranian security forces while waiting for the Home Office to process her visa. Meanwhile, hundreds of women remain trapped under the brutal Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, accused the government of “leaving people in life-threatening situations” and making them “easy prey for criminal smuggler gangs who put them on dangerous small boats”. “It’s time the prime minister and home secretary stopped focusing on media headlines and got a grip of the chaos created on their watch,” she told The Independent. Figures drawn from an official database under freedom of information laws show that the majority of the 11,189 refugees waiting for family reunion visas applied over six months ago, and almost 1,800 have been living in limbo for over a year. More than 7,000 of those stranded are women and girls, and 5,700 were children at the time applications for their safe transfer were made by relatives in Britain. Syria is the top nationality, followed by Eritrea, Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. The borders watchdog has warned that “failing” family reunion processes are leaving women and children in danger while driving up the risk of vulnerable people resorting to Channel crossings to reach loved ones in the UK. The Independent has spoken to a Sudanese refugee whose six-year-old son is stranded in Sudan almost a year after he applied for family reunion (Supplied) But ministers frequently cite the visas as a viable safe and legal route to Britain, while pushing its laws that aim to see all small boat migrants detained, deported and barred from re-entering the UK. When introducing the Illegal Migration Bill to parliament, Suella Braverman said she was “proud” of the scheme, telling MPs: “We have a family reunification scheme to enable family members to join their family here. That is a record of which we should be proud.” The home secretary has frequently brought up family reunions when defending against MPs’ criticism of the Rwanda plan – that if passed will see refugees sent to the African nation to claim asylum there – and other punitive policies, calling it a “crucial” alternative to small boats. “We are proud of those safe and legal routes,” she told parliament in March. “WHEN WE STOP THE BOATS, WE WILL LOOK TO EXPAND THOSE ROUTES.” IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK HAS ALSO FREQUENTLY HAILED THE REUNION VISAS, CALLING ARGUMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT CREATED SUFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES TO SMALL BOAT CROSSINGS “RIDICULOUS”. ‘Shortage of safe and legal routes’ for migrants, Suella Braverman told by Tory MP “Some 45,000 people have come across on family reunion visas,” he said. “We need no lectures on playing our part as a generous and compassionate country.” But Home Office figures show that under 4,500 visas were granted last year, meaning that it would take until 2026 to clear the backlog at that rate, while more applications flow in from desperate families. Scottish National Party home affairs spokesperson Alison Thewliss has lobbied the government on behalf of one of her constituents – an Iranian man who applied for visas for his wife, son and daughter over six months ago. “In the meantime, his family are in danger – his daughter was followed home from school and raped by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,” she said. “This is why people do not wait in-country for the government to process their visas. They do not wait because they are at risk of persecution, rape, danger and torture. “They are not prepared to wait for safe and legal routes, because in many cases they do not exist.” Family reunion is only available to people granted refugee status in the UK, and the record asylum backlog means that many of those making applications will already have been separated from their relatives for years. Refugees can only bring partners and children to Britain, and charities have long been calling for the scheme to be widened to include parents and siblings. Safe Passage, a charity that helps reunite families, said it was handling a case of a nine-year-old girl and her mother who are living in hiding in Afghanistan. The girl has not been able to go to school since the 2021 Taliban takeover, and her separated parents are suffering from worsening mental health and stress. Despite an application for family reunion being made a year ago, and the mother and daughter formally registering their biometric details for the Home Office within weeks, there has been no decision on their visas and caseworkers were told the case was not “sufficiently exceptional” to speed it up. Caterina Franchi, head of legal at Safe Passage International, said: “These delays can have disastrous consequences, as children lose faith in the family reunion process. Sadly, many go on to make a dangerous journey to reach family here as they cannot wait any longer. A report by the borders watchdog found that ‘failing’ family reunion processes could drive up small boats crossings (PA Wire) “Families torn apart by war and persecution shouldn’t have to risk their lives to hug and hold each other.” Ms Franchi said the ministers were limiting refugee routes without “making sure they work”, adding: “This government needs to quickly get a grip on decision-making, and abandon the ‘Refugee Ban Bill’ that would punish people for joining family here any way they can.” Alex Fraser, director for refugee support at the British Red Cross, said too many people were facing “agonising waits to find out if their loved ones, whose lives are often in peril, can join them”. “The government’s Illegal Migration Bill will make the situation much worse if it becomes law, as the vast majority of people who arrive here for protection will be unable to claim asylum and apply for family reunion,” he added. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of providing safe and legal routes for those who need it and more than 46,200 family reunion visas have been granted since 2015, with over half issued to children. “We consider every application very carefully, and remain committed to improving the processing for family reunion applications.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/refugee-family-reunion-safe-route-backlog-b2369985.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20241202165827/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/refugee-family-reunion-safe-route-backlog-b2369985.html

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said a “network of allies” must meet the smugglers head-on after a landmark deal was struck between London and Ankara. More National Crime Agency officers will be deployed to Turkey to work alongside their Turkish counterparts on joint operations targeting criminal gangs and dinghy factories. Officials want to go after the networks’ supply chains and seize items such as engines and life jackets as they are “vital” to their tactics. Many of the vessels used to cross the Channel are manufactured in Turkey Robert Jenrick told the Daily Express: “The beaches of northern France are the goal-line; we must smash the gangs and facilitators upstream, long before they are in striking distance of the UK. “Hundreds of flimsy and unseaworthy small boats and engines are transported through Europe each year for the purpose of illegal migration. “Each consignment is a death trap; each seizure is an opportunity to save lives, end the human misery and stop illegal migrants reaching our shores. “I am determined that the UK is a leading global force in tackling illegal migration and a partner of choice to all those allies who share our determination to defeat it.” The vessels are produced using a similar plastic to that found in children’s bouncy castles Turkey has been identified as a key hub for smuggling gangs, with many of the vessels used to cross the Channel manufactured there. Border Force sources said the vessels are produced using a similar plastic to that found in children’s bouncy castles, before being rolled up onto a pallet and loaded into the back of a lorry. Many migrants hoping to reach Britain also begin their journey there and pay smugglers thousands to cross the continent. The new agreement - signed by Britain and Turkey - says the two nations will share more intelligence on the gangs known to be operating across Europe. And a new headquarters will be established in Turkey, meaning National Crime Agency and Home Office intelligence personnel will work alongside their Turkish counterparts for the first time. Officials insisted this will mean they can react to intelligence quicker. Hundreds of boats are driven across Europe every year, the Home Office said, and both Britain and Turkey will demand other European countries do more to tackle illegal migration during international summits, the agreement states.

Britain launched trade talks with India in January last year, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has stressed that he won't sacrifice quality for speed in negotiations. Last year interior minister Suella Braverman sparked a row with comments about the possible impact of Indian migrants in trade talks, citing concern both with any ""open borders migration policy with India"" and those who overstay visas. Badenoch set out Britain's stance in response to a question about how government ensures it ""speaks with a single voice on migration and mobility in relation to a UK-India trade agreement,"" and avoids ""disruptive political off-stage noises."" ""An FTA with India will not contain commitments on immigration or provide access to the UK domestic labour market,"" Badenoch said in a written response to lawmakers published on Thursday. ""There will also be no agreement to anything which undermines the principles or functioning of the UK's points-based immigration system, or which undermines the UK's ability to control its own border."" SHE ADDED THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WOULD DISCUSS BUSINESS MOBILITY, ""WHICH WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR HIGHLY SKILLED PROFESSIONALS TO DELIVER SERVICES IN EACH OTHER'S MARKETS ON A SHORT-TERM AND TEMPORARY BASIS."" Negotiators were also exploring provisions to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications where it might be possible with regulators, she said. Badenoch has previously warned that the deal may not have everything that the services sector would want.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the Government must clamp down on attractive pull factors to prevent the UK being seen as a “soft touch”. People smugglers will often promise migrants jobs and housing if they pay them thousands of pounds to risk their lives and cross the English channel in flimsy dinghies. Mr Jenrick declared last night: “Making it harder for illegal migrants to work and operate in the UK is vital to deterring dangerous, unnecessary boat crossings. “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue. “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks, and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties.” Employers face fines of up to £45,000 for every illegal migrant they help - triple the previous amount of £15,000. BOSSES WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT HARBOURING ILLEGAL MIGRANTS BEFORE COULD BE HIT WITH A £60,000 PENALTY FOR EVERY WORKER WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN IN THE UK. Government officials say more must be done to prevent UK being seen as 'soft touch' The fines for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes will also rocket, the Home Office confirmed last night. Landlords will be fined £5,000 for every lodger and £10,000 for every occupier of a property. This will double for any repeat offenders. It was previously £80 per lodger and £1,000 for every occupier. The Home Office last night revealed 4,000 employers have been hit with civil penalties since 2018. But only 230 landlords have been fined for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes from them over the same five year period. Officials stated: “Increasing fines will deter employers and landlords from engaging in these illegal and dangerous practices, further deterring people from attempting to come to the UK illegally.” Migrants believe they will face harsher punishments in France than they will in UK, says Mr Jenrick Mr Jenrick told GB News: “We are [reducing the pull factors]. “That’s exactly the work I have been doing over the last six months with Suella Braverman. We have changed the accommodation people are staying in. “The Labour Party say they don’t like us using disused military sites and barges. My post bag from Labour MPs is claiming the accommodation is not luxurious enough. “I think we have to make sure the UK is not perceived to be a soft touch. “The overwhelming majority of the people coming in small boats are coming from France, from a safe country with a well functioning asylum system. “They are choosing to come to the UK and that must be in part because of the perception that the UK is a softer touch. “That is why we are changing accommodation. That is why we are making it harder to live and work illegally in the UK with a 50 per cent rise in the number of raids this year to try and close down bogus employers.” SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

More info Mrs Braverman refused to say whether the Government will stop the boats before the next election The Immigration minister also yesterday confirmed the Government will press ahead with plans to house asylum seekers on cruise ships. The first migrants are expected to arrive on the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge today after a series of delays. But Home Secretary Suella Braverman was dealt a blow as two ports refused permission for two cruise ships to berth and house asylum seekers. Mr Jenrick admitted: “We’re in conversation with a number of other ports and hoping that we can secure those very soon. “It's true that a couple of ports did back out, mostly because local Labour councils like in Birkenhead and in Leith in Edinburgh refused to support us, hypocritically actually if you look at the Leith example. “That's a Labour council that housed Ukrainian refugees on the same barge, same boat, but refused to house asylum seekers, all the time saying that they are a city of sanctuary.” Some 15,121 migrants have crossed the English Channel this year. But ministers and Border Force are braced for a surge in crossings as the weather improves this week. Trending Friday’s arrivals were the first since July 26 amid wind and rain in the Channel. Home Secretary Suella Braverman yesterday admitted that it is “going to be a tough Summer” as the weather improves. Mrs Braverman said: “I look closely at what the incoming flows are like, and we still have too many people coming across the Channel. We still need to honour our pledge to the British people to stop the boats.” But the Home Secretary refused to say whether the Government will stop the boats before the next election.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1799369/No10-to-punish-hiding-illegal-migrants,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1799369/No10-to-punish-hiding-illegal-migrants

The shadow immigration minister, Stephen Kinnock, said the idea makes him “deeply unhappy” as it is the last thing the party wants to do. But he said Labour would have “no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit”. Kinnock told Sky News on Sunday: “Over the last 13 years, the Tory government has destroyed our asylum system. We’ll inherit a mess if we are privileged to win the next election.” When pressed if that meant Labour would continue to use the barges to house asylum seekers, Kinnock said: “The reality is, on day one we will have to deal with the we have and the shambolic mess they have left us. We’ll be left with no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit.” He told BBC Breakfast that he was confident a Labour government could get on top of the backlog within six months. The shadow minister refused to give a timeline on when a Labour government would stop using the barges and bring down the backlog from a record high of more than 172,000 cases. KINNOCK’S COMMENTS CAME AS THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, OLIVER DOWDEN, SAID CHECKS WERE STILL TAKING PLACE ON A CONTROVERSIAL BARGE DESIGNED TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS, WITH THE FIRST GROUP DUE TO BE HOUSED THERE WITHIN “WEEKS”. He said was confident the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, would become operational soon and that the government was taking into account concerns over fire safety. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph Dowden criticised those who have expressed concern over the asylum seeker barge, urging them to stop their “howls of outrage”. The government is to launch a series of immigration policies this week in an effort to show the prime minister is starting to get a grip on one of his five key priorities – to “stop the boats”. Kinnock, speaking on Sunday morning, also accused the Conservatives of “cooking the books” to show they were getting a grip on the spiralling asylum backlog. “They have been artificially withdrawing claims if someone misses an appointment. It doesn’t mean they’ve been processed, it just puts people into limbo. Then essentially people are just slipping into the underground economy,” Kinnock said. More than 6,000 people have been wiped off the list without being fully assessed in just three months, for reasons such as failing to attend interviews or appointments, and not filling in new fast-track questionnaires, the Independent reported.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/06/labour-would-barges-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-stephen-kinnock,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/06/labour-would-barges-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-stephen-kinnock

The New Conservatives group of backbenchers wants to reduce the number of study visas by around 75,000 by excluding the worst universities from eligibility. 1 Tory MPs say slashing immigration must not be compromised to prop up universities Credit: Alamy It is among 12 demands they are making to Rishi Sunak in a new report which they believe will reduce net migration by 400,000. Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”. Yesterday the 25-strong New Conservatives insisted they were not “rebels” and fully supported the PM. Tory Party deputy Lee Anderson fuelled speculation he had been reined in by No10 after pulling out of the event at the last minute - but later claimed to be sick. But the caucus warned Mr Sunak would lose the next election if he “kicked the can” of immigration down the road. RED WALL MP MIRIAM CATES SAID FAILING TO KEEP NUMBERS DOWN “RAISES DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT NATIONAL AND CULTURAL SECURITY”. She said: “Particularly in towns and cities, a huge volume of immigration over over the last 10 years particularly, those of course, change the culture in society very significantly.” Hitting back at critics, Mr Hunt said it was “disparaging to label people xenophobes” for voicing fears about migration. Bury MP James Daly said immigration is the biggest issue to his voters “by a million miles”. And Danny Kruger said his cabal were rallying against the “establishment” on migration reforms. The PM’s spokesman said: “We have to strike the right balance between tackling net migration and ensuring we have the right style to match the needs of the public.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/,http://web.archive.org/web/20230711205606/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/

Crossings resumed on Tuesday, with pictures showing a dinghy packed with men and boys, some without lifejackets, perched on the sides while their legs dangled in the water. According to witnesses, a nearby French patrol vessel appeared to be escorting and monitoring the boat as it floated into UK waters towards Dover before it was met by Border Force and later taken ashore at the Kent port. PRIME MINISTER RISHI SUNAK SAID THE NUMBER OF MIGRANT ARRIVALS WAS LOWER THAN LAST YEAR AND THIS SHOWED HIS PLAN TO 'STOP THE BOATS' WAS 'WORKING'. Provisional Home Office data shows that in 2023 so far 19,801 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel. A group of people thought to be migrants are escorted by a French patrol vessel as they cross the Channel in a small boat travelling from the coast of France The people were believed to have been travelling from the coast of France, heading in the direction of Dover, Kent The supposed arrival comes after it was revealed migrants who land in the UK in small boats could be forced to wear electronic tags under Home Office proposals This is 21 per cent down on this time last year when more than 25,000 people had already made the journey, analysis of Government figures shows. The pace and volume of crossings slowed over the bank holiday weekend, with just 60 people detected making the journey in one boat on Sunday and no crossings recorded on Saturday or Monday, according to revised Home Office figures. Pictures showed people believed to be migrants sitting aboard a dinghy, which was 'escorted' by a French patrol vessel. The boat was then met by Border Force and migrants were taken ashore. The supposed arrival comes after it was revealed migrants who land in the UK in small boats could be forced to wear electronic tags under Home Office proposals. UK charity Refugee Council criticised the plan, claiming it would result in vulnerable people in search of safety being 'treated as mere objects'. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June 2023, up 44 per cent from 122,213 at the end of June 2022. This was the highest figure since current records began in 2010. Figures also show the number of asylum seekers waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year on year from 89,231 and another record. The idea to tag migrants, first mooted more than a year ago, has resurfaced as Rishi Sunak attempts to get a handle on immigration and stop people illegally gaining entry to the UK. The migrants would be GPS tracked in real time and required to report via text message or in person to immigration officers multiple times a day, the Telegraph reported. Border Force officials are pictured helping people thought to be migrants ashore in Dover, Kent, today A group of people thought to be migrants are rescued by Border Force vessel Defender as they cross the Channel in a small boat Border Force escorted the migrants ashore after they were pictured traveling across the Channel towards the UK UK charity Refugee Council criticised the plan to tag migrants, claiming it would result in vulnerable people in search of safety being 'treated as mere objects' Any attempt to remove the tag and abscond would result in any right to bail or to remain in the UK being automatically withdrawn. A source told The Telegraph : 'Tagging is being discussed as an option.' Refugee Council Chief executive Enver Solomon told The Independent: 'It's treating people as mere objects rather than vulnerable men, women and children in search of safety who should always be treated with compassion and humanity, in the same way we welcomed Ukrainian refugees. 'This is not who we are as a country nor the Britain we aspire to be.' Refugee Gulwali Passarlay, who fled Afghanistan, also told the paper that his friend has been made to wear a tag since arriving in the UK as a refugee and that it has impacted his mental health. He said: 'How would normal people feel if they were electronically tagged just for being who they are? We're surveilling the most vulnerable people in our society.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12456905/Bon-voyage-French-patrol-vessel-escorts-migrant-boat-floats-UK-waters-Dover-picked-Border-Force-numbers-asylum-seekers-arriving-Channel-nears-20-000.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12456905/Bon-voyage-French-patrol-vessel-escorts-migrant-boat-floats-UK-waters-Dover-picked-Border-Force-numbers-asylum-seekers-arriving-Channel-nears-20-000.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

News reported in the Guardian has vice-chancellors pleading for a “new model” of government funding. This follows reports that one-third of England’s universities are trading at a deficit. Since almost one-fifth of UK students in higher education now come from abroad – 125,000 of them from China – there is near panic at the Home Office’s determination to slash student immigration. Some universities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, UCL and Imperial, rely on Chinese students alone for between a quarter and a third of their income. This means that any Beijing sanction on Britain – such as for mentioning the Uyghurs too often – could turn off this tap at source. Chinese numbers are already falling, by 4% last year, and are compensated only by soaring numbers for Indians, Nigerians, south-east Asians and 135,000 dependents. This last figure the Home Office is eager to cut. This situation is highly unstable. The number of EU students has plummeted by more than half since Brexit. International students pay between £10,000 and £38,000 a year – the highest fees in the world – and are in effect super-taxing their own, often poor, countries to cross-subsidise UK students. Despite this, the University of Kent already has a £65m deficit and Leicester’s de Montfort a £10m one. Vice-chancellors now have lecturers on strike, crumbling buildings and forced redundancies. In February the vice-chancellor of East Anglia, David Richardson, faced a £30m hole in his budget and resigned. Last month his replacement was flanked by a security guard at a staff meeting. There are other straws in the wind. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance at university lectures and a rise in online learning since Covid. BRITISH STUDENTS ALREADY GRADUATE WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF STUDENT DEBT, IN THE ORDER OF £40,000 TO £50,000, AND AN INCREASING NUMBER WONDER IF IT IS WORTH IT. For almost the first time ever, fresher numbers fell last year. There is a fast rising number of applicants for degree apprenticeships – that is students paid for by employers – and ever fewer employers caring about degree grades. That is why, rather than raise fees, some vice-chancellors are calling for more government cash to go direct to them to cover teaching costs. But the government is already spending huge figures covering the half of student loans that are not repaid. It is a near certainty that no further help will come from that source. The vice-chancellors are right that a new model is needed, but that need is radical. More even than the NHS, British universities cry out for structural reform. The model invented by the Thatcher government, of turning technical colleges into universities, with Tony Blair offering a place to 50% of young adults, has ground to a halt. Student numbers have stalled at near 45%. The age-old tradition of teaching by scholar/tutors has proved inefficient for mass higher education. So, too, has the custom of low numbers of contact hours, coupled with the custom, unique to Britain, of residential high education being the norm. The cost of these archaic practices in time and resources has been and is stupefying. These shifts have been aggravated by Covid, the internet and now AI, and by changes in the skill needs of the economy. The near obliteration of polytechnic and other vocational education has been a disaster. It has led to a chronic shortage of all forms of medical staff, of lab technicians, care workers, primary teachers and administrators. Further education should never have been downgraded. Student residences should not be towering over city centres, as if students were more in need of social housing than the homeless. Radical ideas get nowhere. The tycoon James Dyson has started his own engineering university. The Cambridge academic Stefan Collini cries in the wilderness at the fate of pure scholarship, left awash in a world of target-driven, exam-led, league-tabled mass teaching. The former universities minister Jo Johnson pleads for an end to the three-years-fits-all residential university model, to no effect. Demands for shorter courses, part-time and lifelong learning, restored further education or an expanded Open University fall on deaf ears. So too does the issue of whether vocational courses are best taught in a university at all, rather than in the workplace. What is clear is that it cannot be right to browbeat half of all 19-year-olds into paying £50,000 for three years’ usually mediocre teaching, an “education” supposedly to last a lifetime. The question is not whether it should be replaced but how to bring replacement about. Delivering an answer would best start with the spark that stimulated the burst of university reform that occurred in the 1960s, the Robbins royal commission. Such commissions were considered too ponderous and were succeeded by endless public inquiries, which proved no less ponderous. At least Robbins brought about change. It will take another Robbins to overcome the conservatism of the modern university, which makes the pre-Reformation Church of Rome seem liberal.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/british-universities-foreign-students-deficits-government-higher-education

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The Justice Secretary has defended the Government’s announcement of a “task force” for identifying corrupt immigration lawyers as critics branded it a “red herring” to distract from the asylum backlog. Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “However, there is a small minority that are doing terrible damage, not just because they’re coming up with false claims which means that people are remaining here who ought not to remain here, but doing terrible damage to the reputation of lawyers. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. NOW, WEAK AS EVER, THEY ARE SETTING UP A TALKING SHOP INSTEAD OF CRACKING DOWN ON THOSE WHO ABUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED FOR LABOUR, SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY STEVE REED SAID IT IS “TOO LITTLE TOO LATE” AND THE “BUCK STOPS” WITH THE CONSERVATIVES, ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING “SAT IDLY BY FOR 13 YEARS WHILE ILLEGAL MIGRATION HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the Government must clamp down on attractive pull factors to prevent the UK being seen as a “soft touch”. People smugglers will often promise migrants jobs and housing if they pay them thousands of pounds to risk their lives and cross the English channel in flimsy dinghies. Mr Jenrick declared last night: “Making it harder for illegal migrants to work and operate in the UK is vital to deterring dangerous, unnecessary boat crossings. “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue. “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks, and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties.” Employers face fines of up to £45,000 for every illegal migrant they help - triple the previous amount of £15,000. Bosses who have been caught harbouring illegal migrants before could be hit with a £60,000 penalty for every worker who does not have the right to remain in the UK. Government officials say more must be done to prevent UK being seen as 'soft touch' The fines for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes will also rocket, the Home Office confirmed last night. Landlords will be fined £5,000 for every lodger and £10,000 for every occupier of a property. This will double for any repeat offenders. It was previously £80 per lodger and £1,000 for every occupier. The Home Office last night revealed 4,000 employers have been hit with civil penalties since 2018. But only 230 landlords have been fined for allowing illegal migrants to rent homes from them over the same five year period. Officials stated: “Increasing fines will deter employers and landlords from engaging in these illegal and dangerous practices, further deterring people from attempting to come to the UK illegally.” Migrants believe they will face harsher punishments in France than they will in UK, says Mr Jenrick Mr Jenrick told GB News: “We are [reducing the pull factors]. “That’s exactly the work I have been doing over the last six months with Suella Braverman. We have changed the accommodation people are staying in. “The Labour Party say they don’t like us using disused military sites and barges. My post bag from Labour MPs is claiming the accommodation is not luxurious enough. “I think we have to make sure the UK is not perceived to be a soft touch. “The overwhelming majority of the people coming in small boats are coming from France, from a safe country with a well functioning asylum system. “They are choosing to come to the UK and that must be in part because of the perception that the UK is a softer touch. “That is why we are changing accommodation.

The first migrants are expected to arrive on the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge today after a series of delays. But Home Secretary Suella Braverman was dealt a blow as two ports refused permission for two cruise ships to berth and house asylum seekers. Mr Jenrick admitted: “We’re in conversation with a number of other ports and hoping that we can secure those very soon. “It's true that a couple of ports did back out, mostly because local Labour councils like in Birkenhead and in Leith in Edinburgh refused to support us, hypocritically actually if you look at the Leith example. “That's a Labour council that housed Ukrainian refugees on the same barge, same boat, but refused to house asylum seekers, all the time saying that they are a city of sanctuary.” Some 15,121 migrants have crossed the English Channel this year.

The former shadow home secretary later deleted her tweet, which was a reference to Tory MP Lee Anderson’s use of the f word about migrants. But it prompted indignation on social media, and some commentators called for Ms Abbott to face sanctions. Her tweet was branded “obscene” and “revolting”. Rishi Sunak has backed his deputy party chairman Mr Anderson, who said migrants who do not want to live on a barge should “f*** off back to France”. However, the prime minister’s decision has divided the Conservatives, some warning him against turning the Tories into the “even nastier party” and a lurch to the right. Mr Anderson has refused to apologise for his incendiary comments, made after a group of 20 migrants were granted a last-minute reprieve as the first group boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset. Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, said while the MP’s language was “salty”, his indignation was well placed and his comments were “not bigotry at all”. No 10 said the cabinet minister had been speaking for the government when he backed Mr Anderson. But Dominic Grieve, the ex-attorney general who was a Conservative MP for more than two decades, told The Independent that “such foul language” would turn off floating voters and risked “making the Tories the even nastier party”. Ms Abbott, who in April was suspended from the Labour Party after suggesting Jewish people do not face racism, had been quote-tweeting a BBC news story on a shipwreck in the central Mediterranean, in which 41 people are thought to have died. “These migrants have indeed f***ed off. To the bottom of the sea,” she wrote. It’s thought she had been trying to mock Mr Anderson’s attitude. Some people who did not remember that she had already been suspended from the Labour Party called for her to be suspended or sacked.

Meanwhile, a scheme to give departing offenders £1,000 for leaving is at risk of abuse, as they could come back to the UK later on. The report said the Home Office was managing the cases of 21,094 foreign offenders, including 6,030 in jail, 1,036 in immigration detention and 13,212 living in the community. Yet the number removed from the UK has dropped from a high of 6,437 in 2016 to just 2,676 in 2021 due to Covid restrictions and legal challenges.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS ARE AT RECORD HIGHS, MULTIPLE HOUSING CRISES CHEW AT OUR LIVING STANDARDS AND SECURITY, AND PRIVATISED INFRASTRUCTURE – FROM OUR CREAKING TRAINS TO OUR LEAKING WATER PIPES – OFFERS A SERVICE YOU’D EXPECT FROM A MUCH POORER COUNTRY, ALL AT RIP-OFF PRICES. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. But as we witness Britain’s decline to the status of a poor country with a few rich people in it, we must surely conclude that the Tory scapegoating of migrants played a pivotal role in our nation’s social and economic descent. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration

The news came as the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, demanded the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) come down hard should it uncover any cases of wrongdoing. “I would strongly encourage you to use the full force of sanctions available to you against solicitors where there is a finding of a breach,” Chalk said on Thursday. He spoke after the Daily Mail claimed several individuals working with law firms had been charging thousands of pounds to submit false asylum and human rights claims. An undercover reporter for the paper said they had been offered help in obtaining refugee status in the UK, despite having made it clear to the several advisers they had no legitimate right to stay. On Thursday, Chalk wrote to the SRA to say: “Solicitors are critical to the operation of a fair immigration system. I know that the overwhelming majority take their professional duties and obligations extremely seriously. “HOWEVER, ANY EXAMPLES OF PRACTICES WHICH FALL SHORT OF THE HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS WE EXPECT OF SOLICITORS RISK SERIOUS DISRUPTION TO THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, TARNISHING THE REPUTATION OF THOSE WORKING IN THIS AREA, AND CRITICALLY UNDERMINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE.” COMMENTING ON THE REPORTS, THE PRIME MINISTER, RISHI SUNAK, SAID: “WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY OF LAWYERS TAKE THEIR PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY, THESE ALLEGATIONS OF EXPLOITATION AND UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY THE MAIL ARE TRULY SHOCKING AND IT IS VITAL THAT THOSE FOUND TO BE ABUSING THEIR POSITION FACE THE FULL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS. “I am determined to rebuild the public’s confidence that it is their country and their government who should decide who comes here, not people looking to profit from undermining our laws. That’s why this government will continue to strain every sinew to end the abuse of our system and stop the boats.” The solicitors’ watchdog said: “We can confirm we are investigating the firms/individuals.

Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Saturday night: “Despite this judgement, our commitment to stopping the boats is as strong as ever.” On Saturday night it emerged the Church of England has also attacked the Government’s immigration policies, by accusing Ministers of creating a “boom market” for people smugglers. READ MORE: Rishi Sunak threatens war with Lords over plot to block illegal migrant bill [LATEST] Rwanda scheme foiled by £1.5bn of taxpayer's money In a briefing paper for MPs, bishops said: “Fees to traffickers and smugglers are not simply paid up-front, but often include conditional labour, entrapment and exploitation in the UK to work off the debt incurred from being trafficked. In this way, far from creating deterrence, the UK’s approach is creating a boom market for criminal enterprises.” The handouts were on Saturday night branded taxpayer-funded anti-government propaganda “on a global scale”. Organisations receiving funding include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which advised judges to rule against the government with a submission expressing “longstanding and well-known concerns” about the Rwanda plan. UNHCR said it was “not a claimant in the proceedings but advised the court on matters of international refugee law”. It also encouraged MPs and members of the House of Lords to block the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, saying in March: “We urge the Government, and all MPs and Peers, to reconsider the Bill and pursue more humane and practical policy solutions.” Funding has also gone to the International Organization For Migration, which has said that it is “deeply concerned” about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill. The two global bodies were awarded more than £1.4billion between them from 2012 to 2021. In addition, the Refugee Council accepted £20million in grants from 2017 to 2022 as well as contracts worth £10million, along with funding from the National Lottery. It has attacked the “inhumanity” of the Rwanda plan and claimed it “had to directly intervene to stop young people being removed to Rwanda”. Last week Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon issued a statement welcoming the Court of Appeal ruling, but complained it did not go far enough. He said: “We’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful.” Tom Rylan, a policy analyst with the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “After 70 years of pumping your hard-earned cash into UN bodies and political charities, this same government is facing taxpayer-funded lobbying on a now global scale. “If the Government wants to take back control of asylum policy it must get serious about puncturing the world wide blob.” He accused global quangos of “using their huge influence and resources to influence internal UK policy”.

More info Mr Rylan said: “That’s not to deny their important role identifying refugees, conducting health checks, and resettling them in the United Kingdom. “But these bodies go well beyond these important goals and show little consideration for the difficult political and moral questions that face governments dealing with tens of thousands of asylum claims each year.” Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, a former Home Office Minister, said: “Tax-payers’ money should not be used for propaganda opposing the policy of the elected government. Asylum seekers should be treated humanely, housed and fed, and this is what funding should be used for. “It’s not there to try to block a manifesto commitment being put into effect.” Meanwhile, fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi said: “The time has come for Government to decide if it is right to use taxpayer’s money to fund organisations who actively work against Government policy. There are propaganda machines locally and internationally who clearly object to our Rwanda plan and other Government policies. “So how can it be fair to taxpayers or even rational by any measure that their money should be used against the very things they voted for? This is utterly bizarre and I shall be seeking to bring changes to this nonsense.” On Saturday night Rachael Orr, chair of Trustees at the Refugee Council, said: “Like many charities, one of our primary purposes is to advocate for our beneficiaries – refugees and people seeking asylum. “We use our expertise and knowledge gained from the delivery of our services to constructively engage and challenge Government to take action to improve the lives of refugees which is in line with our charitable objects and purpose. “As set out by the Charity Commission any charity, including the Refugee Council, has a right to lawfully campaign based on the cause it is entrusted with.” Marco Longhi Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Jenrick insisted Rwanda was a safe country with “a proud history of welcoming those in need”. He said: “They are recognised globally for receiving vulnerable migrants from detention centres in Libya, and for welcoming and providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban.” And the removals policy was backed by former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who said suggestions that Rwanda is unsafe were “verging on racism”. He said: “This view that ‘well, it’s in Africa, it must be a desperate country’ – that’s verging on racism. Rwanda is often described as the Singapore or the Switzerland of Africa, so it’s an exceptionally safe country.” Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his support for the Rwanda policy in a newspaper column last week. But he warned it may not be possible to begin removals before the next general election, widely-expected next year. He said: “We must be realistic. There is now a good chance that the law’s delays will be so severe that no illegal arrivals will be sent to Rwanda this year, and perhaps not even next year.” Robert Jenrick Comment by Robert Jenrick - Home Office Minister I am sure Sunday Express readers will have been disappointed by last week’s judgment on our migration partnership with Rwanda. As Immigration Minister I share those sentiments. The country has a proud history of welcoming those in need. They have hosted 140,000 refugees and are recognised globally for providing Afghan girls with an education when they were denied it by the Taliban. Rwanda’s track record – and their shared belief that urgent action is needed to stop people risking their lives by crossing the Channel – is why we chose to partner with them. We fundamentally disagree with the judgment that it is not a safe place, and are seeking permission to appeal. While the legal process takes its course, we are doing everything we can to stop the boats. We have introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which significantly strengthens our ability to remove those who arrive illegally. We are deepening our co-operation with European counterparts to disrupt gangs along the whole migratory route. We stopped nearly 33,000 crossings last year, nearly double that of 2021. We continue to increase the returns of people with no right to be here through deals with safe countries like Albania. MY MESSAGE TO READERS IS THIS: DESPITE THIS JUDGMENT, OUR COMMITMENT TO STOPPING THE BOATS REMAINS AS STRONG AS EVER. We can, we must, and we will prevail.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} There is “no single version of the truth” in the Home Office when it comes to removing foreign criminals from the UK, according to the borders and immigration watchdog. David Neal, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, cited numerous concerns about the process of removing foreign offenders and the process of record-keeping within the Home Office. Ministers in recent months have repeatedly stressed the Government’s push to remove foreign national offenders – those who have been convicted of an offence in the UK and sentenced to at least 12 months in prison. Mr Neal, in his foreword to the report, said that the Home Office “frequently cites its determination to remove foreign national offenders”. This is no way to run a government department David Neal But the watchdog found repeated problems in Home Office operations, describing the approach to record-keeping in one particular area as “no way to run a government department”. In the Commons on Thursday, Labour’s Yvette Cooper attacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman over the “damning” report. “She is running it. This Home Secretary is running this chaos, failing to sort out the boats crisis, failing to clear the backlog or mend the broken asylum system. Failing to get a grip.” The 84-page report offered a detailed look at the removal process and in his foreword Mr Neal found that the “Home Office’s performance in this area is not efficient”. Mr Neal cited particular concerns about the “underperforming” early removal scheme and the availability of data. He wrote: “This inspection found that the only way for the Home Office to identify a nationality cohort awaiting deportation was to manually trawl through multiple spreadsheets. For an operation of this size to be run like this is unacceptable. “For any operation to be effective, there needs to be a single version of the truth, and for FNOs (foreign national offenders) it does not exist. Worryingly, I found no evidence of a strategy to build one.” Elsewhere, he found that there was “insufficient information to effectively identify which FNOs could be removed from the country today”. He said: “The Home Office does not have an overarching view of its case-working system. In order to establish the current state of a particular case, case owners have to manually interrogate individual case records. “This is no way to run a government department.” Shadow home secretary Ms Cooper accused Ms Braverman of having “no grip” over her department and of trying to discreetly publish the damning report when many are distracted by the appeal court ruling over her asylum policy. “While all eyes are on the Government’s chaotic Rwanda policy, this is a shameful attempt by the Home Secretary to slip out a damning report into her failing management of foreign national offenders,” the Labour MP said. “The number of foreign national offender removals has plummeted and Suella Braverman’s Home Office is failing badly on data and casework. HER FAILURE TO FOLLOW BASIC WARNINGS FROM THE INSPECTORATE HAS LEFT MORE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS ON THE STREETS, PUTTING PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/yvette-cooper-home-office-suella-braverman-home-secretary-commons-b2366670.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230629181237/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/yvette-cooper-home-office-suella-braverman-home-secretary-commons-b2366670.html

It is now in the upper house of parliament, where peers could try to weaken some its provisions. ""This won't be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it's so important that we change the law,"" he said.

One firm charged an eye-watering £10,000 to make up a tragic back story to support an asylum application. Responding to the findings, a furious PM tweeted: ""This is what we’re up against. ""The Labour Party, a subset of lawyers, criminal gangs - they're all on the same side, propping up a system of exploitation that profits from getting people to the UK illegally. ""I have a plan to stop it."" Home Secretary Suella Braverman joined in the fury as she put rogue lawyers on notice. ""I expect the authorities to track down and punish any lawyers or firms found to be engaging in these kinds of practices,"" she fumed. ""Labour should reconsider next time they claim our asylum system isn’t being abused."" Opposition MPs hit back at the PM's criticism, describing it as ""pathetic"". Shadow Environment Secretary Jim McMahon said: ""When all else is lost, the only place you have is the gutter. ""Poor yes. Desperate and pathetic from Sunak too."" The row comes as last week the PM finally got his stop the boats bill to pass through parliament. The fresh law will see anyone who comes to Britain by dinghy detained and removed to either their state of origin or a third country. The illegal migrants will also be barred from ever claiming asylum in the UK. RAGING RISHI ADDED: ""LABOUR HAVE TRIED TO BLOCK EVERY VOTE TO STOP THE BOATS.

David Neal, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, cited numerous concerns about the process of removing foreign offenders and the process of record-keeping within the Home Office. Ministers in recent months have repeatedly stressed the Government’s push to remove foreign national offenders – those who have been convicted of an offence in the UK and sentenced to at least 12 months in prison. Mr Neal, in his foreword to the report, said that the Home Office “frequently cites its determination to remove foreign national offenders”. This is no way to run a government department David Neal But the watchdog found repeated problems in Home Office operations, describing the approach to record-keeping in one particular area as “no way to run a government department”. In the Commons on Thursday, Labour’s Yvette Cooper attacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman over the “damning” report. “She is running it. This Home Secretary is running this chaos, failing to sort out the boats crisis, failing to clear the backlog or mend the broken asylum system. Failing to get a grip.” The 84-page report offered a detailed look at the removal process and in his foreword Mr Neal found that the “Home Office’s performance in this area is not efficient”. Mr Neal cited particular concerns about the “underperforming” early removal scheme and the availability of data. He wrote: “This inspection found that the only way for the Home Office to identify a nationality cohort awaiting deportation was to manually trawl through multiple spreadsheets. For an operation of this size to be run like this is unacceptable. “For any operation to be effective, there needs to be a single version of the truth, and for FNOs (foreign national offenders) it does not exist. Worryingly, I found no evidence of a strategy to build one.” Elsewhere, he found that there was “insufficient information to effectively identify which FNOs could be removed from the country today”. He said: “The Home Office does not have an overarching view of its case-working system. In order to establish the current state of a particular case, case owners have to manually interrogate individual case records. “THIS IS NO WAY TO RUN A GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT.” SHADOW HOME SECRETARY MS COOPER ACCUSED MS BRAVERMAN OF HAVING “NO GRIP” OVER HER DEPARTMENT AND OF TRYING TO DISCREETLY PUBLISH THE DAMNING REPORT WHEN MANY ARE DISTRACTED BY THE APPEAL COURT RULING OVER HER ASYLUM POLICY. “While all eyes are on the Government’s chaotic Rwanda policy, this is a shameful attempt by the Home Secretary to slip out a damning report into her failing management of foreign national offenders,” the Labour MP said. “The number of foreign national offender removals has plummeted and Suella Braverman’s Home Office is failing badly on data and casework. Her failure to follow basic warnings from the Inspectorate has left more dangerous criminals on the streets, putting public safety at risk.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/yvette-cooper-home-office-suella-braverman-home-secretary-commons-b2366670.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230629181237/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/yvette-cooper-home-office-suella-braverman-home-secretary-commons-b2366670.html

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, Home Office figures show, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. The rise in asylum applications waiting for an initial decision is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”, the Home Office said. However, the number of cases awaiting a decision has risen by less than 1 per cent in the three months to the end of June, suggesting the rise is slowing down. “This is in part due to an increase in the number of initial decisions made, and an increase in the number of asylum decision makers employed,” the Home Office added. But the growing backlog is a blow to the prime minister, who has promised to clear it by the end of the year to cut the £6 million-a-day it costs the taxpayer to house migrants in hotels. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the increase shows “the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system”. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day,” he said. Charity Refugee Action called on the government to give those waiting more than a year for an asylum decision leave to remain. It also urged ministers to allow asylum seekers to work while awaiting decisions on their claims. “The huge backlog in asylum decision-making is a product of the government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives,” the charity’s head of asylum services Rachel Goodall said. She said thousands were being forced into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and Ministry of Defence sites. “Only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit,” she added. And think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned the government’s approach to the asylum backlog risks “pushing people underground”. The figures come afterThe Independent this month revealed that government is now withdrawing more claims than it decides, sparking accusations the backlog is being cut “by the back door”. Thursday’s figures showed a 47 per cent surge in the number of asylum decisions withdrawn, suggesting the backlog is being driven down by withdrawing claims rather than decisions being made. IPPR associate director for migration Marley Morris said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” Charity Freedom from the charity Torture said the “huge” backlog of asylum seekers is “the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect”. Associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” The British Red Cross said huge waiting times for decisions are taking a toll on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Its executive director of strategy and communications, Christina Marriott, said: “With numbers increasing, there’s no time to waste. Claims must be processed more efficiently to help people settle into communities, start work, and get on with their lives.” It came as the overall number of asylum applications in the year to June also hit a two-decade high of 78,768, a fifth higher than a year earlier. The Home Office said this “partially reflects an increase in small boat arrivals to the UK”. In the year to June, 52,530 migrants were detected entering the UK via irregular routes, which include small boats, lorries and shipping containers – 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. And of these, 44,460 per cent arrived via small boats, a jump of more than a quarter compared with a year earlier, the Home Office said. MR SUNAK PLEDGED IN JANUARY TO “STOP THE BOATS”, BUT HAS SINCE ADMITTED IT IS A “COMPLEX” ISSUE AND SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION EXPECTED NEXT AUTUMN. The Home Office pointed to a slight fall in the number of small boat crossings between January and June, but admitted “comparisons of arrivals between the same months in different years may likewise be affected by differences in weather conditions”. Labour has said any fall in crossings so far this year was due to bad weather.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-prime-minister-government-policy-b2398686.html,

It’s all there for us to see. “Not just in his pledges before becoming leader, but in his voting record in Parliament. He’s soft on illegal immigration and has always voted against any attempt to control our borders. “The sheer scale and frequency of his U-turns has got to the point where it’s almost pointless taking seriously anything he says or any position he adopts as it’s highly likely to change within weeks. He’s devoid of principle and a backbone.” Labour promised in 2021 to invest £28 billion a year until 2030 in green projects if it came to power, but has now rowed back on that pledge, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves saying this figure would instead be a target to work towards in the second half of a first parliament. The rowback sparked warnings from environmental analysts, as well as political opponents and Labour’s back benches, who said Britain is already floundering in its green initiatives compared with other nations. But Ms Reeves, who is keen to demonstrate a firm grip on public finances, said exercising “responsibility” with borrowing should be the priority amid soaring interest rates and high inflation.

The charity Every Child Protected Against Trafficking (ECPAT) brought legal action against the department over the practice of housing unaccompanied youngsters in Home Office-run hotels, claiming the arrangements are “not fit for purpose”. In a ruling on Thursday, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the practice is unlawful and had been used since at least December 2021. Following the ruling, ECPAT’s chief executive, Patricia Durr, said: “It remains a child protection scandal that so many of the most vulnerable children remain missing at risk of significant harm as a consequence of these unlawful actions by the Secretary of State and Kent County Council.” The court has confirmed that there can be no exceptions when the rights of vulnerable children are concerned Enver Solomon, Refugee Council She added the decision was a “clear and timely reminder” about the legal obligations of local and national government towards all children in the wake of the passing of the Illegal Migration Act. The Refugee Council’s chief executive welcomed the ruling. Enver Solomon said: “It is a landmark day for children’s rights. “The court has confirmed that there can be no exceptions when the rights of vulnerable children are concerned. “The Government should do everything in its power to ensure these children are safe and in the care of local authorities.” The court previously heard that 154 children remained missing from hotels, including a 12-year-old. Mr Solomon added: “Most importantly, we are still waiting to hear what is happening to the 154 children who are still missing. “There can be no compromise when it comes to children’s safety and welfare, and we hope the Government will take the necessary steps to find the missing children and ensure they are safe.” Children’s charity the NSPCC said it would be “urging the Government to find solutions” to protect and support all children and young people coming to the UK. No child should be placed in hotel accommodation Anna Edmundson, NSPCC Anna Edmundson, head of policy at the NSPCC, said: “Unaccompanied children entering the UK have already experienced major trauma and require protection and support whatever their immigration status. “This ruling rightly reinforces how that protection and support is best provided by local authority care. “No child should be placed in hotel accommodation.” The Liberal Democrats said that Home Office policy has once again been shown to be “immoral” and “unworkable” as they called for the end of hotel use. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: “Yet again, Home Office policy under the Conservatives is immoral, unworkable and unlawful too, as the High Court has just ruled. “This confirms what we have been saying for months – that housing asylum-seeking children in squalid hotels is totally unacceptable. “IT’S HIGH TIME FOR THE HOME SECRETARY TO FINALLY COMMIT TO ENDING THE USE OF THESE HOTELS IMMEDIATELY. “Sadly, this Conservative government has decided that their anti-refugee rhetoric is more important than safeguarding children from exploitation.” The Home Office said it has maintained that unaccompanied children are best placed with a local authority. A department spokesperson continued: “However, due to the unsustainable rise in illegal Channel crossings, the Government has had no option but to accommodate young people in hotels on a temporary basis while placements with local authorities are urgently found. “In light of today’s judgment, we will continue to work with Kent County Council and local authorities across the UK to ensure suitable local authority placements are provided for unaccompanied children, in line with their duties.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/high-court-home-office-nspcc-home-secretary-alistair-carmichael-b2383107.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230801034712/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/high-court-home-office-nspcc-home-secretary-alistair-carmichael-b2383107.html

Ministers reacted with fury to the Court of Appeal verdict in favour of several asylum seekers and a charity fighting against the Government policy. Campaigners called for the Government to drop its plans to send asylum applicants to Rwanda following the court ruling that the plan to deport migrants was unlawful amid concerns over the east African nation's asylum system. In a majority decision, judges overturned an earlier High Court ruling that said Rwanda could be considered a “safe third country”.

""I am horrified that the new proposed accommodation of the Premier Inn has been identified and would like to know why Gravesham was specifically identified out of 728 potential Premier Inn's across England,"" he said.

The Refugee Council urged the Government to respond with “compassion” to the incident while Freedom from Torture accused ministers of “hostile” attitudes towards refugee protection. Opposition MPs said the tragedy highlighted the need for action to prevent dangerous crossings being made. Kolbassia Haoussou, from Freedom from Torture, said: “The tragic news of yet more deaths in the Channel, including serious injuries to many others, demonstrates the continued failure of the UK Government’s hostile approach to refugee protection. “The UK Government has used the demonisation of refugees as a tactic to distract us from their failings, which have left us with a cost-of-living crisis, the NHS on its knees, and public sector strikes. If this Government fails to humanely address this issue, then innocent lives will continue to be lost.” Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the incident “underscores the need for meaningful action” to reduce dangerous crossings, and urged the Government to focus on creating an “orderly and humane asylum system”. “We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in today’s sinking of a boat in the English Channel. Our hearts go out to the victims, survivors, and their loved ones. We also thank the rescuers who helped save many lives under harrowing circumstances,” he said. He accused the Government of “focusing on passing expensive and unworkable legislation and shutting down existing safe ways to get to the UK”, adding: “There are constructive alternatives we have set out that would create an orderly and humane asylum system.” Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it is “desperately” necessary to stop dangerous crossings and “the terrible criminal smuggling gangs who profit while lives are lost.” “Awful news coming from Channel. Another tragedy with yet more lives lost or at risk,” she said. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the latest incident was an “appalling, deeply shocking tragedy”. “WE MUST STOP THESE CROSSINGS AND DEFEAT THE CRIMINAL PEOPLE SMUGGLERS,” HE WROTE ON TWITTER. “There can be no more headline-chasing gimmicks or madcap schemes that just make everything worse.” Natalie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, said the fatal incident reinforced the need for joint patrols in the Channel. “Today’s tragedy underlines why we must stop the small boats to keep people safe and prevent loss of life in the Channel,” she said. “These overcrowded and unseaworthy deathtraps should obviously be stopped by the French authorities from leaving the French coast in the first place. “The time has come for joint patrols on the French coast and a cross-Channel security zone before any more lives are lost.” A UK Government spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident in the Channel. HM Coastguard are working on a co-ordinated response and further information will be provided in due course.” Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: “My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic loss of life in the Channel today. “I have spoken with our Border Force teams this morning who have been supporting the French authorities in response to this incident.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/channel-uk-government-nhs-government-natalie-elphicke-b2392031.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/channel-uk-government-nhs-government-natalie-elphicke-b2392031.html

Mr Jenrick sparked controversy after allegedly ordering the removal of the murals at the centre in Kent, which depicted characters such as Baloo from The Jungle Book and Mickey Mouse. Initial reports suggested this was because it was deemed “too welcoming”. But speaking in response to Labour’s Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, Mr Jenrick on Tuesday claimed in the Commons the “set up” in the centre was altered because most of the children in the centre were teenagers. Ms Cooper asked: “Can he explain: is it true that he gave orders to the asylum reception centre to paint over children’s cartoons? “If so, why? Because nobody believes that Mickey Mouse cartoons either encourage or deter boats to arrive, and they simply think that this is the minister actually not showing some common decency to vulnerable children.” He replied: “We provide very high quality care at all of the centres in which we support unaccompanied children. “We didn’t think that the set-up in that particular unit was age appropriate because the majority of those individuals who were unaccompanied passing through it last year were teenagers. “That does not change the fundamentals that we support anyone who comes to this country with decency and compassion.” The story was first reported by the I newspaper, which reported that staff at the centre were “horrified"" by the ""cruel order”. In the Lords on Monday, Home Office Minister Lord Murray told peers that artworks weren’t initially commissioned by the Home Office. “It’s clearly the correct decision that these facilities have the requisite decoration befitting of their purpose,” he said. Among those criticising the department’s stance was Tory donor Lord Brownlow, who said he was “quite frankly ashamed” of the minister’s answer. It comes as MPs debate amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter people from crossing the Channel by toughening up the rules and conditions around seeking asylum. Peers in the House of Lords placed some 20 amendments to the bill, the majority of which are expected to be rejected by Tory MPs.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} Efforts to clear the asylum backlog need to significantly increase to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of dealing with older cases by the end of the year, a spending watchdog said. The National Audit Office (NAO) questioned whether the plans were sustainable, saying it would take 2,200 decisions on cases a week to clear the backlog by the end of the year – but during April just 1,130 weekly decisions were made. The NAO estimated that £3.6bn was spent on asylum support in 2022-23, almost double the amount in the previous year. In December, the prime minister pledged to clear the backlog of around 92,601 “legacy” cases which had been in the system as of the end of June 2022. The NAO said: “The Home Office is starting to reduce the backlog of ‘legacy’ claims, from more than 100,000 at the beginning of July 2022 to about 77,000 by the end of April 2023. “However, to achieve this it has decided to abandon its ambition to make decisions on ‘newer’ claims within six months, meaning the backlog of ‘newer’ claims is growing. “The Home Office estimates the number of ‘newer’ claims awaiting a decision will increase from almost 61,000 in April 2023 to around 84,000 by the end of December 2023.” In total, some 173,000 people relating to 134,000 claims were waiting for an initial asylum decision at the end of March. The NAO added that “some senior Home Office staff described how pressure to deliver on short-term political priorities made it hard to focus on the longer-term strategy”. The watchdog said the business case for the Home Office’s asylum and protection transformation programme package of reforms was “based on a range of highly uncertain assumptions”. NAO chief Gareth Davies said: “Despite recent progress, the asylum and protection transformation programme is a long way from meeting government’s ambitions to reduce the cost and improve the quality of the service. “The Home Office has nearly doubled the number of decisions made each week, although it is unclear whether it will be enough to remove the backlog of older asylum decisions by the end of 2023. To date, the programme is not on track to achieve the expected benefits. “The changes the Home Office plans to implement through the programme are necessary, but not on their own sufficient, to address the pressures in the asylum system. “To achieve value for money, the Home Office needs to better co-ordinate and manage the impacts of these changes, otherwise the department risks moving backlogs and cost pressures to other parts of the system – including local authorities – rather than resolving them.” The Government is working non-stop to reduce the asylum backlog and deliver cheaper, more orderly alternatives to hotel accommodation Home Office spokesman Dame Meg Hillier, Labour chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: “The backlog of 173, 000 people waiting for an asylum claim decision costs taxpayers billions every year. “The asylum and protection transformation programme was supposed to make asylum decisions quicker and sort out accommodation costs, but Government still has a very long way to go to deliver on its promises to abolish the backlog of initial decisions. “Unless the Home Office better understands and manages how the asylum system works on the ground, the programme will shunt issues to other areas by increasing the number of appeals and removals, and further breach the trust of asylum seekers and the public.” The Home Office insisted it was on track to clear the legacy backlog by the end of the year. “The Government is working non-stop to reduce the asylum backlog and deliver cheaper, more orderly alternatives to hotel accommodation,” a Home Office spokesperson said. “As the NAO acknowledges, we have already doubled the number of caseworkers and cut the legacy backlog by 20%, but we know more must be done to bring the asylum system back into balance. “The Illegal Migration Bill will stop the boats by detaining those who come to the UK illegally, and swiftly returning them to their home country or a safe third country.” Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said: “The Conservatives have lost control of the asylum backlog, which has risen from 19,000 in 2010 to an astonishing 172,000 today at an astronomical cost to the taxpayer. “TODAY’S NAO REPORT SHOWS THAT THE COST OF THE ASYLUM SYSTEM LAST YEAR WAS EVEN GREATER THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED – ALMOST DOUBLING TO AN ASTONISHING £3.6BN. “The NAO is right to highlight how the Prime Minister’s focus on the ‘legacy claims’ is in essence a red herring, and that the actual backlog is likely to see an influx of another 23,000 claims by December.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/national-audit-office-home-office-asylum-backlog-b2358681.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230616045042/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/national-audit-office-home-office-asylum-backlog-b2358681.html

Jenrick also deflected questions on Sunday about how many people had been removed from the UK under a “gold standard” UK-Albanian deal, which targets people arriving illegally from Albania mainly by crossing the Channel. He said hundreds of people had been removed but that others were still being housed in hotels or had absconded. Jenrick told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday show it was still “early days” under the deal and that “spurious last minute claims” had held up deportations. The deal with the Albanian authorities had been lauded by Rishi Sunak as the prime minister came under pressure from the right of the Tory party after figures showed more than a third of people who arrived on small boats in the UK via the Channel in the first nine months of 2022 were from Albania. While Jenrick initially said thousands had been removed to Albania, he went on to qualify this by saying: “There are hundreds of Albanians who’ve arrived on small boats who have been placed on those flights as a result of the processes we put in place and the agreements that we’ve reached with Albania.” The government is under renewed pressure from its own backbenches after figures published last month showed net immigration to the UK had increased from 488,000 in 2021 to 606,000 in 2022. THE FIGURE FOR LAST YEAR IS NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER IN 2018. Jenrick told the BBC that net immigration was “far too high today”. But when asked about a pledge under David Cameron to limit immigration to “tens of thousands” of people a year, Jenrick said: “I don’t think that targets like that are particularly helpful because migration is an extremely challenging space where behaviours are constantly changing.” He said a lot of progress had been made on illegal immigration in a short period of time, with “really unique landmark deals” with France resulting in a “big increase” in the number of interceptions on the beaches. But Jenrick said the asylum system, which, according to him had a backlog of more than 150,000 cases, must be changed “fundamentally”. He said the illegal migration bill would alleviate the pressure. The government’s asylum bill – which is supposed to change the law so that those who arrive in the UK by irregular means can be removed to a third country such as Rwanda – goes before the House of Lords this week. It is expected to face significant opposition from peers and could be amended or delayed until later in the year. Defending the government’s record during a round of broadcast interviews on Sunday, Jenrick said a lot of progress had been made on illegal immigration in a short period of time. But he told the BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “The asylum system is riddled with abuse, we have to be honest with ourselves.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guardian Headlines UK Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Westminster city council’s leader wrote to the home secretary, Suella Braverman, to express “deep concern” that about 40 refugees had been placed in the borough on Wednesday night “without appropriate accommodation or support available … and no prior communication with the local authority”. Jenrick said: “As I understand what happened here was that these migrants, who had themselves said that they were destitute, they had nowhere to stay, we had offered them a safe bed with board and lodgings in a good-quality hotel in central London. “Yes, some of them had to share with other people. These are single adult males: I don’t think that’s unreasonable,” he said, adding that the government wanted to reduce the cost to the taxpayer. Jenrick denied it was government policy to tell asylum seekers they had to share four to a room in hotels, but said it was “completely fair and reasonable” to ask single adult males to share a room.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/04/uk-asylum-system-immigration-reduction-targets-albania,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/04/uk-asylum-system-immigration-reduction-targets-albania

Home Secretary Suella Braverman attacked the “politicised” European Court of Human Rights for blocking deportations. 1 Home Secretary Suella Braverman has slammed 'politicised' European Court of Human Rights for blocking illegal migrant deportations Credit: PA She was confident of getting flights to Rwanda going but stressed: “If we’re thwarted in Strasbourg, we will do whatever it takes.” Tory MPs are urging ministers to quit the ECHR to ensure it cannot issue any more 11th-hour orders if the Rwanda scheme gets the go-ahead from the Supreme Court. Ms Braverman said the Government is not “talking about leaving the ECHR right now” but put Euro judges on notice. She told the BBC: “My personal views are clear. It’s a politicised court. It’s interventionist. It’s treading on the territory of national sovereignty.” She accused a “range of forces” including left-wing campaigners and lawyers intent on thwarting the Government’s pledge to stop the boats. And she blasted Labour for actively wanting to “facilitate illegal migration”. Charities have fought to stop the Rwanda plan, which was ruled lawful by the High Court but overturned by the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court will make the final decision this autumn. The asylum backlog has now seen a record 175,000 awaiting a decision — with taxpayers footing a £4billion annual bill to house migrants. Under new laws, the Home Secretary now has a duty to detain illegal migrants — but space in detention centres is limited to just 2,500.

Hundreds were due to stay on Catterick Garrison, which is in Rishi Sunak’s constituency. The Home Office is attempting to make major savings on the £6million-a-day bill for putting up arrivals in hotels. One Army source claimed that garrison commander Lt Col Jim Turner had rejected Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s plan, saying it would threaten a regeneration scheme in the North Yorkshire military town. But a senior government source dismissed this view yesterday and told the Daily Express: “The Army is scared of asylum seekers. They claim they are a threat.” Immigration minister Robert Jenrick had revealed plans to use the base to host asylum seekers in March. READ MORE Sunak’s migrant plans thrown into chaos as RAF Scampton plan delayed by months Migrants coming ashore needing places to stay He told Parliament the proposals had been “brought forward”, adding “we cannot risk becoming a magnet for the millions of people who are displaced” by offering them hotel rooms. Around 51,000 migrants are in the taxpayer-funded accommodation. The Express understands officials want to use “empty” buildings at the base – the Army’s largest operational garrison – but are still trying to agree on plans that “ensure the uninterrupted delivery of military activity”. The base, some 20 miles south of Darlington, is home to 13,000 people and contains 19 barrack compounds. A defence source said: “Part of the land they were going to use [for redevelopment] was the land they were going to use for the asylum accommodation. “The garrison commander said they can’t have part of that land as it was going to be included in the first part of the investment scheme. They have reviewed it and they have come to a different decision. As we understand it, it is being reviewed. We don’t think it is going to be used [for asylum accommodation].” Trouble for the Immigration minister as plans crumble SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

More info The source said the Home Office wanted to go ahead with plans to put migrants in empty buildings despite warnings that it may impact the redevelopment scheme. They claimed officials said ‘We want to use this land because we want it for asylum accommodation’. “But the garrison commander said, ‘If you take the land, it will impact the investment’. My understanding is the Home Office said ‘We don’t care’, even though the Army said this was a bad idea. That is when politics came into it.” Another defence source dismissed suggestions of a row, but said that those involved are “working through what’s possible”. A government spokesman said last night: “Work is ongoing to bring forward accommodation at Catterick Garrison. “This work is part of our broader efforts to move to a more orderly, cost-effective and sustainable system for accommodating asylum seekers using alternative sites.” Ms Braverman unimpressed with setbacks against migrants plans Some 14,782 migrants have crossed the Channel this year but the next three months are expected to be the busiest, with trafficking gangs nearing peak activity in the better weather. A total of 45,755 crossed to Britain last year and the busiest months were August, September and October. Ms Braverman wants to house asylum seekers in former military bases, on barges and on disused cruise ships. The Home Office has also bought large tents for up to 2,000 migrants.

The oldest asylum seeker yet discovered pretending to be a child was actually found to be 41, Robert Jenrick said. He told MPs that medical assessments - thought to include X-rays or MRI scans - will initially run in parallel with existing tests which are based on behavioural and language studies. ‘That will happen over the course of this year,’ Mr Jenrick told MPs in the Commons. ‘The oldest individual that we’ve encountered who posed as a child was subsequently found to be 41 years of age. ‘We do take the issue of age assessment extremely seriously. Scientific age assessments of migrants who claim to be children will start this year, the immigration minister Robert Jenrick confirmed today Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai (pictured) who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year ‘There are individuals who abuse the system - that’s wrong as a matter of principle but it’s also a serious safeguarding risk to genuine children. ‘IT’S IMPORTANT THAT WE WEED OUT THOSE CASES OF ABUSE BECAUSE IT POSES SUCH A RISK. ‘I’m afraid we’ve seen some very tragic instances such as the murder that occurred in Bournemouth at the behest of somebody who had posed as a child.’ Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year. Abdulrahimzai was on the run from murder charges in Serbia when he arrived in Britain, and was later convicted in his absence of gunning down two people with a Kalashnikov assault rifle. The Home Office commissioned a report, published in January, which said migrants suspected of pretending to be children could undergo a range of medical tests to determine their true age. It recommended a combination of X-rays of the wisdom teeth and the hand or wrist, plus MRI scans of the knee or collarbone. The move may prove controversial because medics have opposed the use of X-rays for non-medical reasons. Other shocking cases in which adult asylum seekers claimed to be children include Ahmad Otak who in 2012 forced his ex-girlfriend to watch him murder her sister and her friend after she refused to take him back. Mr Roberts was murdered by Abdulrahimzai following an argument over a scooter in Bournemouth A court heard the Afghan lied about his age to get preferential treatment from social services, but Otak was actually 22. Others include Parson’s Green terrorist Ahmed Hassan, who posed as a 16-year-old before setting off a bomb on a Tube train in west London in 2017, injuring 23 people. A judge said he was satisfied the bomber was between 18 and 21. Other adult migrants have ended up in schools being taught alongside young teenage children. Migrants who claim to be under 18 receive better housing and support, a more sympathetic hearing in their asylum claim and are less likely to be detained. Under current rules, local authorities are not allowed to carry out physical examinations of asylum seekers suspected of lying about their age. Instead, social workers estimate the person’s age by assessing their behaviour and language skills. In 2021 the British Dental Association said it ‘vigorously opposed’ using dental X-rays to establish asylum seekers’ ages.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER {{ /VERIFYERRORS }} FORMER HOME SECRETARY KEN CLARKE HAS SAID BRITAIN MUST ACT ON ILLEGAL MIGRATION AS HE CALLED ON PEOPLE TO “GIVE THE RWANDA SCHEME A CHANCE TO WORK”. Last month in the House of Lords, Mr Clarke backed the “extraordinary” small boats law and has reconfirmed his position as the Illegal Migration Bill is set for its third reading on Monday afternoon. Everyone knows that it is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here. Ken Clark Writing in The Telegraph, Mr Clarke said while he has advocated the benefits that migrants bring to Britain, “doing nothing about illegal immigration is not an option”. He said: “Importantly, in all the debate about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, no one has advanced an alternative. “I have listened keenly for an idea of how else we might deal with the mounting problem of irregular migration, but answer has come there none.” The flagship legislation passed through the House of Commons but has met fierce opposition in the Lords. It aims to ensure those who arrive in the UK without permission will be detained and promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda. Mr Clarke said he is not making his comments out of “slavish loyalty” and he has not always been an admirer of the Government. But he lauded the Government’s approach to welcoming in Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong. He said: “We are not becoming a walled-in, closed country. That is a good British contribution to a tremendous problem for the whole of the Western World. “Everyone knows that (illegal migration) is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here.” It comes as 1,070 migrants crossed the Channel in 13 boats on Friday and in seven boats on Saturday, according to Home Office figures. That takes the provisional total for the year so far to over 12,500 people.

The oldest asylum seeker yet discovered pretending to be a child was actually found to be 41, Robert Jenrick said. He told MPs that medical assessments - thought to include X-rays or MRI scans - will initially run in parallel with existing tests which are based on behavioural and language studies. ‘That will happen over the course of this year,’ Mr Jenrick told MPs in the Commons. ‘The oldest individual that we’ve encountered who posed as a child was subsequently found to be 41 years of age. ‘We do take the issue of age assessment extremely seriously. SCIENTIFIC AGE ASSESSMENTS OF MIGRANTS WHO CLAIM TO BE CHILDREN WILL START THIS YEAR, THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER ROBERT JENRICK CONFIRMED TODAY MR JENRICK WAS REFERRING TO THE CASE OF AFGHAN ASYLUM SEEKER LAWANGEEN ABDULRAHIMZAI (PICTURED) WHO FATALLY STABBED ASPIRING ROYAL MARINE TOM ROBERTS LAST YEAR ‘THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ABUSE THE SYSTEM - THAT’S WRONG AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE BUT IT’S ALSO A SERIOUS SAFEGUARDING RISK TO GENUINE CHILDREN. ‘It’s important that we weed out those cases of abuse because it poses such a risk. ‘I’m afraid we’ve seen some very tragic instances such as the murder that occurred in Bournemouth at the behest of somebody who had posed as a child.’ Mr Jenrick was referring to the case of Afghan asylum seeker Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai who fatally stabbed aspiring Royal Marine Tom Roberts last year. Abdulrahimzai was on the run from murder charges in Serbia when he arrived in Britain, and was later convicted in his absence of gunning down two people with a Kalashnikov assault rifle. The Home Office commissioned a report, published in January, which said migrants suspected of pretending to be children could undergo a range of medical tests to determine their true age. It recommended a combination of X-rays of the wisdom teeth and the hand or wrist, plus MRI scans of the knee or collarbone. The move may prove controversial because medics have opposed the use of X-rays for non-medical reasons. Other shocking cases in which adult asylum seekers claimed to be children include Ahmad Otak who in 2012 forced his ex-girlfriend to watch him murder her sister and her friend after she refused to take him back. Mr Roberts was murdered by Abdulrahimzai following an argument over a scooter in Bournemouth A court heard the Afghan lied about his age to get preferential treatment from social services, but Otak was actually 22. Others include Parson’s Green terrorist Ahmed Hassan, who posed as a 16-year-old before setting off a bomb on a Tube train in west London in 2017, injuring 23 people. A judge said he was satisfied the bomber was between 18 and 21. Other adult migrants have ended up in schools being taught alongside young teenage children. Migrants who claim to be under 18 receive better housing and support, a more sympathetic hearing in their asylum claim and are less likely to be detained. Under current rules, local authorities are not allowed to carry out physical examinations of asylum seekers suspected of lying about their age. Instead, social workers estimate the person’s age by assessing their behaviour and language skills. In 2021 the British Dental Association said it ‘vigorously opposed’ using dental X-rays to establish asylum seekers’ ages.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12288771/Age-tests-migrants-claim-children-start-year-Robert-Jenrick-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" from crossing the English Channel as one of his five pledges after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of hundreds of migrants in hotels after record numbers arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. The opposition Labour Party said Sunak had failed to clear the backlog of tens of thousands of asylum claims and that 7,600 people had crossed the English Channel so far this year. Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving can produce results. HE SAID A DEAL WITH ALBANIA HAD MEANT THAT BRITAIN WAS RETURNING MORE MIGRANTS TO THE COUNTRY AND THAT LONDON WAS INCREASING ITS PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION FOR THOSE AWAITING IMMIGRATION DECISIONS. Sunak said so far this year ""the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%"" and that Britain was now accepting one in 50 Albanian asylum cases compared with one in five previously. More than 5,000 asylum seekers in total would be moved out of hotels - which currently cost 6 million pounds ($7.4 million) per day - into two new sites and two new vessels, the interior ministry said. Sunak urged parliament to pass his new Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for the swift detention and deportation of people arriving on small boats back to their homeland or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda.

Home Office figures also show that a million visas were handed out to foreign students and workers. Meanwhile, Britain’s asylum bill has doubled to nearly £4billion a year, despite the PM’s vow to “stop the boats”. The shocking government figures revealed earlier tonight that: ILLEGAL migrants totalled 52,000 in the 12 months to June 2023 — up 17 per cent; JUST 4,000 foreign criminals were sent back home; FAMILY visas more than doubled to 75,000; SEVEN in ten asylum seekers had their claims accepted — up from 30 per cent in the years before the pandemic. The PM has vowed to eliminate the backlog of people who have been waiting the longest for their cases to be heard but it still stands at 62,000. Another 345 made the journey on Wednesday, making this fortnight, with 4,000 arrivals, the busiest this year.

But he admitted that the Government has more to do to reduce the “vast expense” to taxpayers. The cost of the asylum system ballooned to £3.96billion from £2.11billion in a year as the total of migrants waiting for a decision rose to a record high. Tory MPs last night said the immigration system is “not fit for purpose” and urged “root and branch reform”. But the Prime Minister told the Daily Express: “The best way to relieve the unsustainable pressures on our asylum system and unacceptable costs to the taxpayer is to stop the boats in the first place. “That’s why we are focused on our plan to break the business model of the people smugglers facilitating these journeys, including working with international partners upstream to disrupt their efforts, stepping up joint work with the French to help reduce crossings and tackling the asylum backlog. READ MORE Figures show asylum seekers applying to UK highest in two decades Rishi Sunak urges to stop the boats “We’ve already reduced the legacy backlog by over 28,000 – nearly a third – since the start of December and we remain on track to meet our target. “But we know there is more to do to make sure asylum seekers do not spend months or years – living in the UK at vast expense to the taxpayer – waiting for a decision.” Mr Sunak added: “That’s why we’ve doubled the number of caseworkers over the last two years and continue to recruit more, and we are streamlining and modernising the end-to-end process with improved guidance, more focused interviews and rolling out the use of digital technology.” The Home Office spent £3.97billion on the asylum system in 2022/23, up from £2.12billion in a year. A decade ago the cost to taxpayers was £500.2million. Around £2.3billion a year is being spent on hotel rooms for 51,000 migrants. Some 175,457 people were waiting on an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June – up 44% from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since 1999.

Of migrants hoping for refugee status, 139,961 had been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision, up 57 percent year on year and another record high. The Home Office said the rise in the asylum backlog is “due to more cases entering the asylum system than receiving initial decisions”. New asylum applications in the year to the end of June were also at a 20-year high of 78,768. Channel migrants made up around 41 percent of all asylum claims. But cases waiting to be dealt with rose by less than 1 percent in the same three months, suggesting that the increase is slowing down. Labour yesterday said the system was in “complete chaos”, claiming that only 1 percent of Channel migrants who arrived last year had received an asylum decision. But immigration minister Robert Jenrick alleged Sir Keir Starmer’s plan was “simply to wave illegal migrants through the system faster”. HE ADDED: “SMALL BOATS NUMBERS ARE 15 PERCENT DOWN ON LAST YEAR, AGAINST A BACKDROP OF RISING NUMBERS OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE. We are also on track to reduce the legacy backlog of asylum claims.” Robert Jenrick slammed Labour's approach Trending Mr Jenrick claimed that Labour’s approach was “a recipe for even more illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings. “We are getting on with tackling the source of the problem by deterring young men from ever leaving the safety of France in a flimsy dinghy. We’ve passed the toughest piece of immigration legislation in decades, increased returns to the highest level since the pandemic and surged raids on illegal employers by 50%.” A total of 19,174 asylum seekers in 405 boats have reached the UK via the Channel this year. Another 300 in six boats were intercepted by Border Force staff yesterday and taken into Dover harbour. They included children plus a toddler in a pink-and-black coat. The PM has vowed to clear the backlog of 92,601 “legacy” cases – those which have been in the system since June 2022 – by the end of this year. Some 67,870 such applications were awaiting a decision on June 30 so staff need to consider 11,300 cases each month. Legacy cases fell by 11,084 from the end of March to the end of June – nearly 3,700 cleared per month. Some Tory MPs believe that highlights how broken the system is. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke slams costs Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “This is a shocking waste of our hard-earned money. The asylum system is not working for British taxpayers and costs far too much. There needs to be root and branch reform to deliver a better deal.” Tim Loughton MP, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said: “The immigration system is still not fit for purpose.The Home Office has got to do a heck of a lot better in improving processing and turnaround times.” Britain has signed a £480million deal with Paris to boost patrols on French beaches and to increase the number of drones scanning for would-be migrants hiding in dunes. The Government is also seeking more cooperation on smuggling routes with countries like Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Albania and Libya. Tony Smith, an ex-director general of Border Force, suggested Britain and France should jointly patrol the Channel and return migrants to France. He said: “There is provision in international law to do that. But the deal would have to be that the migrants would be taken directly back to Calais.

All children receive a welfare interview, which includes questions designed to identify potential indicators of trafficking or safeguarding issues. “Our priority is to stop the boats and disrupt the people smugglers.

The shadow immigration minister, Stephen Kinnock, said the idea makes him “deeply unhappy” as it is the last thing the party wants to do. But he said Labour would have “no choice but to deal with the mess we inherit”. Kinnock told Sky News on Sunday: “Over the last 13 years, the Tory government has destroyed our asylum system. We’ll inherit a mess if we are privileged to win the next election.” When pressed if that meant Labour would continue to use the barges to house asylum seekers, Kinnock said: “The reality is, on day one we will have to deal with the we have and the shambolic mess they have left us. WE’LL BE LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO DEAL WITH THE MESS WE INHERIT.” HE TOLD BBC BREAKFAST THAT HE WAS CONFIDENT A LABOUR GOVERNMENT COULD GET ON TOP OF THE BACKLOG WITHIN SIX MONTHS. The shadow minister refused to give a timeline on when a Labour government would stop using the barges and bring down the backlog from a record high of more than 172,000 cases. Kinnock’s comments came as the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said checks were still taking place on a controversial barge designed to house asylum seekers, with the first group due to be housed there within “weeks”. He said was confident the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, would become operational soon and that the government was taking into account concerns over fire safety. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph Dowden criticised those who have expressed concern over the asylum seeker barge, urging them to stop their “howls of outrage”. The government is to launch a series of immigration policies this week in an effort to show the prime minister is starting to get a grip on one of his five key priorities – to “stop the boats”. Kinnock, speaking on Sunday morning, also accused the Conservatives of “cooking the books” to show they were getting a grip on the spiralling asylum backlog. “They have been artificially withdrawing claims if someone misses an appointment. It doesn’t mean they’ve been processed, it just puts people into limbo. Then essentially people are just slipping into the underground economy,” Kinnock said. More than 6,000 people have been wiped off the list without being fully assessed in just three months, for reasons such as failing to attend interviews or appointments, and not filling in new fast-track questionnaires, the Independent reported.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/06/labour-would-barges-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-stephen-kinnock,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/06/labour-would-barges-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-stephen-kinnock

The immigration minister also refused to rule out a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Conservatives hone their anti-Labour attacks about asylum policy for the upcoming General Election. “We’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and bring order to our asylum system,” he said on Times Radio as he promoted a new migration partnership with Turkey. Refugee groups insist that asylum seekers have every legal right to challenge their forced relocation to the barge, which is moored off Portland, and have accused the Government of threatening to make them homeless if they refuse. But Mr Jenrick said the Government, while legally bound to provide basic accommodation, was under no obligation to offer them an “à la carte menu” of options as it battles to cut down a daily bill of £6m on asylum hotels. “We’ve written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel, and as I understand a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move,” the minister said. “A significant number moved yesterday. I expect more will move in the coming days. And so I think this issue will be resolved. But as I say, we’re a generous country. We want to support people appropriately and in accordance with the law. “If you’re destitute then obviously you’ll accept the decent accommodation that the state is able to provide for you.” A Home Office spokesperson refused to say how many were now aboard the Bibby Stockholm. But Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the barge as “a sign of failure” by the Government, noting that 10,000 more asylum claimants have been moved into hotels since Rishi Sunak vowed to “stop the boats” coming across the Channel as one of five pledges the Prime Minister made in January. The asylum backlog now stands at 173,000, costing the taxpayer £5,000 every minute for hotels, she said. Labour would end the use of hotels and barges, “going back to the low-cost, long-standing asylum accommodation of which we have tens of thousands of places in this country”. But pressed on Labour’s asylum policy answer if the party is returned to power, Ms Cooper said: “We don’t know what the scale of the chaos is going to be.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230811083055/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-bibby-stockholm-asylum-government-portland-dorset-yvette-cooper-b1099520.html

ONE OF THE 'LEGAL ADVISERS' INVESTIGATED, VP LINGAJOTHY, EXPLAINED HOW BY CONCOCTING A HORRIFYING TALE OF SEXUAL TORTURE, BEATINGS, SLAVE LABOUR, FALSE IMPRISONMENT AND DEATH THREATS, HE WOULD ENSURE HIS CLIENT'S CLAIM SUCCEEDED. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. Another, as we reveal today, told our undercover reporter that the tedious process of claiming asylum would be much accelerated if he 'found a girl' and 'arranged a marriage' — even though getting married for immigration purposes is illegal when the relationship is bogus. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair?

The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

But if you're an opportunistic politician with all the backbone of a jellyfish (Starmer), then the answer is yes. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad. That's why it's so important for organisations and individuals in positions of authority to respect the truth, however unpalatable. And why it's so damaging when, as in the case of these lawyers, they don't.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337277/SARAH-VINE-Lefts-got-say-corrupt-immigration-lawyers-actual-truth-doesnt-fit-one-sided-view.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

KEN CLARK WRITING IN THE TELEGRAPH, MR CLARKE SAID WHILE HE HAS ADVOCATED THE BENEFITS THAT MIGRANTS BRING TO BRITAIN, “DOING NOTHING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS NOT AN OPTION”. He said: “Importantly, in all the debate about the Government’s Illegal Migration Bill, no one has advanced an alternative. “I have listened keenly for an idea of how else we might deal with the mounting problem of irregular migration, but answer has come there none.” The flagship legislation passed through the House of Commons but has met fierce opposition in the Lords. It aims to ensure those who arrive in the UK without permission will be detained and promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda. Mr Clarke said he is not making his comments out of “slavish loyalty” and he has not always been an admirer of the Government. But he lauded the Government’s approach to welcoming in Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong. He said: “We are not becoming a walled-in, closed country. That is a good British contribution to a tremendous problem for the whole of the Western World. “Everyone knows that (illegal migration) is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here.” A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, from a Border Force vessel, following a small boat incident in the Channel in May (Gareth Fulle/ PA) It comes as 1,070 migrants crossed the Channel in 13 boats on Friday and in seven boats on Saturday, according to Home Office figures.

In a Westminster Hall debate in the Commons former minister Sir John Hayes, the chairman of the powerful Common Sense Group of rightwing MPs, named 15 cities whose population equates to the total increase of population in Britain brought about by net migration in the last two decades. Sir John is known to be a close friend and ally of the Home Secretary who he mentored when she was first elected as an MP. Privately, a number of MPs believe that his attack on the Conservative record in office was a coded message for the Government to give her more support in reducing net migration. MS BRAVERMAN WAS UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE ONLY ACCEPTED THE JOB FROM RISHI SUNAK IF SHE HAD A FREE HAND TO BRING NET MIGRATION DOWN. Sir John Hayes is worried about net migration He pointed out that when he first stood for Parliament in 1987 net legal migration was a mere 2,000. A decade later when he was elected as an MP in 1997 it had increased to 47,000 but from then on it exploded under Sir Tony Blair. He said: ""In total, under the last Labour government, total migration was 3.6 million – so, while nearly a million British citizens emigrated, net migration topped 2.7 million ""The rate of inflow between 1997 and 2010 equated to one migrant arriving every minute. ""In every year since 1997 bar one – 2020, when the world was locked down – net migration was in excess of 100,000, often by a big margin. ""Indeed, net migration has averaged around 250,000 per year over the past two decades.""

""Over the 20 years since 2001, the UK population increased by eight million of which nearly seven million was due to immigration. ""To put that in context, that equates to the populations of Birmingham, Manchester, Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds Leicester, Liverpool, and Newcastle plus Peterborough, Ipswich, Norwich, Luton and Bradford."" The attack was aimed at some of Ms Braverman's Cabinet colleagues who are resisting her efforts to bring net migration down because of the desire for cheap labour.

I’m asking largely about healthy young people, albeit exhausted ones. Migrants, who have braved long, terrible journeys, often experiencing horrific violence and terror. So how many should we write off as justifiable collateral damage in our war against … what, exactly? There is no war except with ourselves: it’s a culture war. The cause is “strong borders”, but strong against what? Despite the rhetoric, this not an invasion. If the strong borders are to protect our economy – well, these are young, fit workers who could boost our economies if we actually let them work. The question of what number of deaths is acceptable is pertinent because we are actively pursuing policies that increase these avoidable deaths. So far this year, more than 2,000 people are estimated to have drowned in the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach European shores. About 650 people died when a single overcrowded boat sank off Greece in June. Just 104 were rescued. THIS MONTH, 41 PASSENGERS DIED OFF THE COAST OF ITALY, 63 PERISHED TRYING TO REACH SPAIN, AND AT LEAST SIX PEOPLE DIED IN THE CHANNEL OFF THE FRENCH COAST, WHILE TRYING TO REACH BRITAIN IN A SMALL BOAT. The number of deaths rises as we normalise them. Will we reach a point of revulsion, where the public can no longer tolerate such tragedy, or will such a threshold rise with the deaths and the diminishment of our humanity? It is almost exactly eight years since the image of a drowned toddler washed up on a Mediterranean beach shocked the world into compassion. Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old, escaping war in Syria, had been attempting to reach Europe with his family when their small boat capsized on 2 September 2015. But the humane speeches from leaders proved a temporary reaction and, although the number of refugees seeking safety in Europe has fallen far below those at the height of the Syrian conflict, border policies have hardened and leaders have grown ever more hostile in speech and actions. We have allowed the political discussion around migration to be dominated by populist party sloganeering and driven by the sales agenda of tabloids with confected campaign stories. It has resulted in a swath of brutal and costly policies in Europe and north Africa, where people at their most vulnerable are tormented with impunity – and in no safe routes. In the UK, where mismanaged and delayed processing of asylum claims has created a backlog of more than 136,000 applicants who are forbidden to work, hotel housing costs are running at about £2.3bn a year. Thus riled by his government’s failures, Sunak has declared war on asylum seekers with a barrage of measures from the cruel to the unworkable to the ridiculous. These include last month’s drastic Illegal Migration Act, which torches the universal right of any human from anywhere to seek safety somewhere else on Earth (if that somewhere is Britain), and immigration minister Robert Jenrick’s petty removal of comforting cartoon murals at a detention centres holding traumatised children. ‘By the end of Sunak’s special week, the Bibby Stockholm’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated, owing to the risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease.’ Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images Sunak’s “small boats week” was not a community-awareness event marked by bake sales and fun runs in support of refugees and the RNLI. Instead, there was talk of sending migrants to Ascension Island, a remote rock in the middle of the Atlantic (even more ludicrous than the Rwanda plan), and the spectacle of a serving senior MP, a Conservative party deputy chair, telling asylum seekers to “fuck off back to France”. Meanwhile, the government pushed ahead with its plans to incarcerate a few hundred people – roughly 1% of those waiting for claim processing – on a densely packed barge off the south coast, despite expert warnings of fire and disease risk and, even more unforgivably, despite the discovery of legionella bacteria in water samples. By the end of Sunak’s special week, the barge’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated again, owing to the undeniably high risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease. This is performative politics, it is not leadership worthy of this nation, it is not governance fit for this time of true global crises. When will we look pragmatically at human movement and discuss a workable plan to manage it sustainably? The number of people moving across the world is only going to increase in coming decades, owing to population expansion and global warming, contributing to conflicts, disasters and food shortages that push people from their homes. By one estimate, there are more than 110 armed conflicts going on around the world and yet, in the UK, we receive a tiny proportion of asylum seekers per citizen compared with EU nations, let alone internationally. This is not an immigration crisis – but in the coming decades, it very much could be if we don’t plan today. This year, we’ve seen a taste of the climate chaos that will only worsen, with fires, floods, hurricanes and heat affecting nations on every continent displacing millions of people. In six years, some 2 billion people could be living in places where average temperatures exceed 29C; by the end of the century, this number approaches 4 billion. This summer, traumatised British refugees arriving in small boats from the wildfires in Rhodes were treated with kindness and generosity by Greek communities when they landed. They were lucky enough to have the papers (and skin colour) to receive asylum. It is in all of our interests to prevent a climate apartheid of safety on our shared planet. Even if we in the UK are not directly affected by extreme conditions, as holidaymakers or residents, we are, by extension, through our globalised human network. For instance, about half of our food is grown overseas, much of it in highly vulnerable areas, thus increasing prices. As conditions become too extreme, people will have to move. So too will capital, expertise, production, industry … everything will shift in response. The number is not fixed, and we still have plenty of choices. If we want fewer people to move, we need to fund places to adapt, and to rapidly speed our decarbonisation so the push factors aren’t worse. But inevitably people will move. We need an honest discussion about how we manage this movement, in our cities, nationally, and in collaboration with neighbouring nations – most of which are, like Britain, facing a shrinking labour force. This must be a moment of decision. Do we plan a workable way forward, adapting our border policies to accommodate the reality of this movement? Or do we decide that mass drownings of healthy young people are just fine?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars

I am appalled that solicitors and so-called 'legal advisers' should have behaved in such a way. To make matters worse, the cynical practices uncovered by the Mail appear to be widespread. Up to 40 law firms suspected of coaching asylum claimants to present false stories of persecution and oppression are now under investigation.

Encouraging illegal immigrants to get married to a British resident may be an old ruse, but it's still as effective. Handing out anti-depressants to use as 'evidence' of trauma is less well-known, but equally vile. By misleading the court, as these advisers proposed doing, not only are they in breach of their professional duties, but many would be committing criminal offences: namely, perverting the course of public justice, which usually – and rightly – results in an immediate custodial sentence. READ MORE: Fury as the Bar Council attacks Rishi Sunak after the Prime Minister criticised immigration lawyers exposed by the Mail as trying to help migrants falsely claim asylum Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/debate/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> The aspect of this investigation that I find most grotesque is that these lawyers clearly don't care about the people they claim to protect, that is, refugees and asylum seekers. THEIR ACTIONS MAKE IT HARDER FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED TO HAVE THEIR CLAIMS FAIRLY HEARD. It is almost beyond my comprehension that advisers working for firms governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority could instruct applicants on how to make up stories. For the firms that employ these advisors, ignorance should be no defence. The senior solicitors might not themselves have urged claimants to lie, but it is their responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen. There should have been safeguards, such as regular audits, to make sure employees were behaving ethically and lawfully. Their failure should carry severe consequences. One of the great popular myths about the legal profession is the idea that we lawyers treat the truth as something flexible. The question I'm always asked in a black cab is: 'How can you defend a murderer when you know he's guilty?' And the answer is: 'I can't defend him if he tells me he did it. Legally and ethically, it's forbidden.' Every law student learns legal ethics at the very start of their training. It's impossible to gain any qualifications without understanding them. In fact, one of my favourite dictums – and one that I pass on to young people coming into the profession – is: 'Never do anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the Daily Mail.' That's a great rule of thumb to help concentrate the mind on where the grey areas of ethics start. But the alleged behaviour of these lawyers in flouting immigration rules is not in any grey area. If true, it's as bad as any criminal I've prosecuted. If these allegations are proven, these men must be struck off, imprisoned and disgraced.

Mr Sunak wore heavy boots and a stab vest as he joined officers on the raid in Brent, north west London, early on Thursday morning. It comes after he promised to abolish the backlog of around 92,000 asylum claims by the end of 2023. However, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs on Wednesday that the target will not be met at the “current pace”. Asked after the raid about Ms Braverman’s comments, Mr Sunak said: “It was good to be out this morning with our immigration enforcement team and seeing first-hand their work to tackle illegal working. “That’s an important strand of our work, to stop the boats and tackle illegal migration. “And that’s because the criminal gangs use a business model that tempts people here with the offer of black market work. “It’s not right, which is why we’ve increased resources for immigration enforcement. “We’ve increased the number of raids like the one I was on this morning by 50% and we’ve doubled the number of arrests.” He added: “But we’re not complacent. “THERE’S LOTS OF WORK TO DO, WHICH IS WHY IT’S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE PASS OUR BILL THROUGH PARLIAMENT, OUR STOP THE BOATS BILL, WHICH WILL MEAN THAT IF YOU COME HERE ILLEGALLY, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAY. “We will be able to detain you and then swiftly remove you.” Not long after Mr Sunak returned from the raid, Ms Braverman met French interior minister Gerald Darmanin in London.

No British government in democratic history has presided over such an acute period of national decline. The average Briton is set to be no better off in 2026 than they were in 2008, and the poorest fifth are more than 20% poorer than their French and German counterparts. Economic growth has been weak, and there has been an unprecedented slowdown in the nation’s productivity levels. Hospital waiting lists are at record highs, multiple housing crises chew at our living standards and security, and privatised infrastructure – from our creaking trains to our leaking water pipes – offers a service you’d expect from a much poorer country, all at rip-off prices. The social hubs that rescue us from isolation are being wiped off the map, from libraries – nearly 800 closed in the 2010s – to nightclubs – a third have vanished in the past three years alone. Our town centres are becoming deserts of shuttered windows, pound shops and US candy stores. In these circumstances, it is perhaps understandable that a Conservative prime minister will desperately reach for a big red button labelled “immigration”. Having manufactured the phenomenon of refugees arriving in small boats by closing down safe and legal routes, the Tories believe the sight of desperate, dishevelled foreigners clambering on to British shores will deflect public anger away from the country’s multiplying crises. And that, in large part, is why we’re in such a grave mess in the first place. Throughout their ruinous turn in power, the Tories have sought to blame migrants for problems directly caused by government policy. When David Cameron was prime minister, he endorsed the claim that immigration was a “constant drain” on public services. His home secretary, Theresa May, moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants, falsely claiming she couldn’t deport one “illegal migrant” because he owned a cat, and arguing that new arrivals had “put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing”. Given her government’s slashing of public services – including per pupil funding in schools – and failure to build housing, this conveniently turned migrants into the Tories’ human shields. ‘Theresa May moulded her political career around scapegoating migrants.’ Photograph: WPA/Getty Images But the Conservatives did succeed in inflaming popular passions against a demonised foreigner blamed for sapping public services, making immigration a top priority for 44% of voters by 2015. By doing so, they ensured a victory for leave in the referendum of 2016, paving the way for a Brexit that has achieved nothing other than further reducing growth and living standards, leaving 63% of Britons to conclude Brexit was more of a failure than a success, with just 12% suggesting the opposite. The historical moment underlines a political truism: it is politicians seeking to blame foreigners and minorities for society’s ills who pose the greatest danger to a nation. This tragic historical fact was most devastatingly illustrated in 1930s Germany, culminating as it did in genocide, but it doesn’t need to be taken to such an extreme conclusion to inflict harm. Donald Trump rose to power, in part, by demonising Muslims, but no minority in the US represents any sort of threat to a now embattled democracy, unlike the far-right movement he stirred up. Witness the decline of Hungary and Poland into autocracy, pioneered by political parties that built popular support, in significant part, by demonising migrants. Rational, factually grounded fears shouldn’t be directed at migrants and minorities, but at politicians who seek to gain power by blaming them for the ills and injustices they caused. There are reasons to doubt that Sunak’s morally debased campaign will succeed: attitudes towards immigration have improved, with only 9% of voters regarding reducing it as a top priority, and the country’s crises are too calamitous to shift the blame from the ruling party. BUT AS WE WITNESS BRITAIN’S DECLINE TO THE STATUS OF A POOR COUNTRY WITH A FEW RICH PEOPLE IN IT, WE MUST SURELY CONCLUDE THAT THE TORY SCAPEGOATING OF MIGRANTS PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN OUR NATION’S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DESCENT. For many years, a significant chunk of the electorate were convinced by claims that migrants really were responsible for soaring NHS waiting lists, strained local schools, the absence of affordable housing, and all manner of other social disorders. That deflected scrutiny away from the real causes, leaving the sickness untreated. Will we finally learn, I wonder, that it’s those who demonise fellow humans from foreign lands who pose the greatest danger, not those who flock to our shores and enrich our communities, culture and lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/rishi-sunak-small-boats-tories-immigration

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} The Justice Secretary has defended the Government’s announcement of a “task force” for identifying corrupt immigration lawyers as critics branded it a “red herring” to distract from the asylum backlog. Alex Chalk said the unit, for which there is no new funding, will aim to ensure advocates who are found to be responsible for submitting fraudulent claims are “convicted, punished and disgraced”. Touring broadcast studios on Tuesday, he said it was right to root out a “tiny minority” of lawyers damaging the reputation of others in the profession. It comes as David McNeill, from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, accused the Government of “lawyer-bashing” with an announcement containing apparently little substance. Mr McNeill said the “task force” – bringing together civil servants, regulatory bodies and law enforcement – has been in existence for months, despite its “official launch” by the Home Office on Monday. The Justice Secretary acknowledged that the unit had been in operation for some time, but told BBC Breakfast: “The Law Society is right that it’s a tiny minority of lawyers and the overwhelming majority of lawyers in this country do an extremely important job. “HOWEVER, THERE IS A SMALL MINORITY THAT ARE DOING TERRIBLE DAMAGE, NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY’RE COMING UP WITH FALSE CLAIMS WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE REMAINING HERE WHO OUGHT NOT TO REMAIN HERE, BUT DOING TERRIBLE DAMAGE TO THE REPUTATION OF LAWYERS. And it is absolutely right that we crack down on them.” The Law Society has said the necessary powers are already in place to deal with immigration advisers engaged in misconduct. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) prohibits lawyers from deceiving courts, and any act of dishonesty or lack of integrity may result in them being struck off. The Home Office said those ultimately found guilty of helping people remain in the country by fraudulent means could face life imprisonment, which is already the maximum sentence for assisting unlawful migration under the Immigration Act 1971. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels - 50,000 David McNeill, Law Society Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McNeill accepted that improper practice sometimes occurs in the industry, but added: “It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly… this announcement today is something of a red herring. “This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the Government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” Mr Chalk said the Professional Enablers Taskforce has been developing resources to ensure Home Office lawyers are “better trained to identify evidence of fraud”. This has included the development of a new training package for frontline staff who work in the immigration system to help them identify and report suspect activity. The Justice Secretary, a former barrister, said professionals should not be granted “immunity” from the law “simply because they are lawyers”, telling GB News he is “absolutely comfortable” with the crackdown. But Bar Council chairman Nick Vineall KC warned the task force “must not fall into the trap of identifying lawyers with the causes of their clients, nor should it assume that misbehaviour by clients amounts to misbehaviour by lawyers”. Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed For Labour, shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said it is “too little too late” and the “buck stops” with the Conservatives, accusing them of having “sat idly by for 13 years while illegal migration has spun out of control”. He said: “Now, weak as ever, they are setting up a talking shop instead of cracking down on those who abuse our immigration system.” It comes as the Government kicks off a “stop the boats” week of linked announcements on immigration. The first migrants boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday, amid others being granted a last-minute reprieve after a series of legal challenges. Mr Chalk admitted it is “frustrating” that just 15 have arrived on the 500-capacity vessel but insisted it “doesn’t diminish our resolve to solve this”. He defended Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, who said asylum seekers complaining about the Bibby Stockholm barge should “f*** off back to France”. “Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yes, he does it in salty terms, that’s his style, but his indignation is well placed,” the minister told LBC. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, currently an Independent MP, wrote on Twitter: “A new low even for the Tories.” Taxpayer money is being spent on housing migrants “in some cases in 4-star hotels”, Mr Chalk confirmed, which he said is why the Government is looking at cheaper alternatives. Around 20 asylum seekers did not board the barge as planned on Monday because their transfers were “cancelled” after lawyers challenged the decisions. Official figures released on Monday confirmed the number of migrants staying in hotels passed 50,000 in June. Mr Chalk said on Tuesday that the backlog of asylum claims has decreased by 17,000 over “recent weeks”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/alex-chalk-lee-anderson-justice-secretary-government-people-b2389403.html,

But for Rishi Sunak, these are not normal times. The presence of Lee Anderson among the New Conservatives, a pressure group of predominantly “red wall”-based 2019- and 2017-intake Tory MPs, is just one of the eyebrow-raising elements of their decision to intervene on migration. The group held a formal launch on Monday for its 12-point plan to cut immigration – policies which, if implemented, would have a fairly dramatic impact on not just immigration but the economy more widely. The stated ambition is to reduce annual net migration from 2022’s 606,000 to 240,000 in 2024, involving significant cuts to visas for care staff, further curbs on student visas, a big rise in the minimum salary threshold for skilled workers and a cap on refugee numbers. It was devised by a group including Anderson, the combative Ashfield MP who Sunak made Tory deputy chair in February – although he dropped out of appearing at the launch event. The emergence of the plan raises a series of interlinked questions, including what it says about the renewed salience of immigration as a political issue, and the authority of Sunak – plus of course whether the proposals are even realistic. The return of migration as a concern for restive backbenchers marks a change from the immediate post-Brexit period, when the proportion of voters who named it as among their most pressing issues dropped as low as 15%. This is now back up to 35%, rising to nearly 60% among Tory voters, caused by both the increase in net migration, and people including Nigel Farage prompting a political panic about refugees making Channel crossings. Grumbles about immigration are not a exactly new thing for Tory prime ministers, but the emergence of such a concerted and notably detailed parallel policy will be seen as another sign that while Sunak is not at risk of an open challenge by his party, neither is he really in charge of it. With the Conservatives consistently up to 20 or more percentage points behind Labour, it is perhaps of little surprise that some of Sunak’s MPs – notably those in vulnerable red wall seats – want drastic action. In pure party management terms, even if the New Conservatives could muster their claimed 25-strong number, this is unlikely to trouble Sunak in the Commons. But at the same time, functional political parties do not generally propose two simultaneous immigration policies. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is nonetheless fair to say that plenty of other Conservative MPs would worry about the wisdom of trying to implement such massive reductions so fast, especially in a care sector already struggling to fill vacancies. ASKED ABOUT THE PRACTICALITIES OF THE PLAN, MIRIAM CATES, THE MP FOR PENISTONE AND STOCKSBRIDGE – ANOTHER LEADING FIGURE IN THE NEW CONSERVATIVES – TOLD BBC RADIO 4 THAT MINISTERS SHOULD “MAKE CARE WORK AN ATTRACTIVE CAREER FOR BRITISH PEOPLE” AND INVEST MORE IN SKILLS, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRODUCTIVITY. That is not a new argument – in fact it is one already made in very similar terms by Labour. Nevertheless, it is usually phrased as a long-term aspiration, not something to be done in little more than a year. It was notable that when Cates was asked what sort of hourly rate might be needed to attract UK nationals to care work, she replied: “I don’t know.” With such basic questions unanswered, it is probably fair to say that the New Conservatives will not get their way on immigration policy.

Speaking to the BBC, he said he had to look after taxpayers and his duty was to the British public over migrants. He added it was ""fair and reasonable"" to ask asylum seekers to share rooms in hotels in some circumstances. It follows a dispute with asylum seekers over their temporary accommodation in central London. Last week, about 40 asylum seekers were offered space in a Pimlico hotel, but refused to enter after being asked to sleep four people per room. Head of Westminster Council Adam Huq expressed his concern in a letter to the home secretary, saying people who ""are likely to have been through significant and traumatic events"" were being asked to share ""an inappropriately sized room with multiple strangers"". ASKED ABOUT THE CASE ON THE BBC'S SUNDAY WITH LAURA KUENSSBERG PROGRAMME, MR JENRICK SAID THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT WANT TO USE HOTELS, ARGUING IT WAS ""TAKING AWAY VALUABLE ASSETS FOR THE LOCAL BUSINESS COMMUNITY... PEOPLE'S WEDDINGS AND PERSONAL EVENTS HAVE HAD TO BE CANCELLED"". ""But where we are using them, it's right that we get good value for money for the taxpayer,"" he added. ""And so if single adult males can share a room, and it's legal to do so, which will obviously depend on the size of the accommodation, then we'll ask people to do that,"" he added. However, he denied it was government policy for asylum seekers and migrants to be housed in shared rooms. He also said the UK's asylum system was ""riddled with abuse"" and that the country could not be allowed to be ""perceived as a soft touch"". Labour said in response: ""After 13 years of Tory failure, the asylum system isn't just broken - it's costing tax payers a fortune - only Labour has a proper plan to stop dangerous boat crossings."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made reducing the numbers coming to the UK illegally one of his key priorities. Part of his plan is to implement the Illegal Migration Bill, currently going through Parliament. It would give ministers new powers to remove anyone arriving in the UK illegally and stop them claiming asylum here. But it has attracted fierce criticism including from the Archbishop of Canterbury, who said it risked ""great damage"" to the UK's reputation. The BBC understands the Home Office estimates the plans in the bill could cost between £3bn and £6bn through spending on detention facilities, as well as ongoing accommodation and removals. Last year the number of people arriving in the UK in small boats via the English Channel hit over 45,000 - the highest number since figures were first collected in 2018. The government is trying different ways to accommodate the rising numbers of people who are coming to the UK, including housing people in barges or facilities on air bases. Mr Jenrick was keen to repeat his assertion that the government is taking a robust approach, and that by asking migrants to share rooms he wants to cut the costs to the taxpayer. But he was less keen to acknowledge that the backlog for asylum claims is extremely high, and that compared to a few years ago, it takes much longer for cases to be resolved. The problems with accommodation at 395 hotels around the country would be far less acute if there were fewer people stuck in the system. When it comes to how ministers handle the issues there are not many easy answers. But while Conservative ministers say they want to bring immigration down, they have presided over the numbers going up and up. There is a serious clash between the rhetoric and the reality.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65802335,http://web.archive.org/web/20241207145942/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65802335

Justice Secretary Alex Chalk has urged the regulator to use the ""full force of sanctions"" at its disposal. Writing to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Mr Chalk said: ""Solicitors are critical to the operation of a fair immigration system. I know that the overwhelming majority take their professional duties and obligations extremely seriously. ""However, any examples of practices which fall short of the high ethical standards we expect of solicitors risk serious disruption to the immigration system, tarnishing the reputation of those working in this area, and critically undermining public confidence.""

  The first small group of asylum seekers has boarded the controversial Bibby Stockholm housing barge after a series of delays over safety concerns. Up to 500 men will eventually live on the vessel in Dorset while they await the outcome of asylum applications. Some human rights groups have said housing people on board the barge is ""inhumane"" and locally opponents are worried about the impact on services. But ministers insist the boat is safe and will be cheaper than using hotels. It is believed a small number of migrants have already boarded the vessel, with more expected to embark by the end of Monday. Bibby Stockholm is the flagship of the government's latest plan to ""stop the boats"" and deter dangerous Channel crossings by migrants. Home Office Minister Sarah Dines said it would provide ""basic but proper accommodation"" and would send ""a forceful message that there will be proper accommodation but not luxurious"". ""There are extensive plans underfoot and it will be a... gradual upping of the numbers,"" she added. The 222-room, three-storey barge arrived in Portland Port three weeks ago, chartered by the government to reduce what it says is the £6m-a-day cost of placing asylum seekers in hotels. Ministers plan to increase the numbers aboard up to 500, despite safety warnings from the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) which has raised concerns over narrow exits and possible overcrowding. Watch the moment Bibby Stockholm docks at Portland
  The Home Office says the men aged 18-65, from various countries, could spend nine months on board the barge, which has previously been used to accommodate homeless people and asylum seekers in Germany and the Netherlands. Senior ministers hope to confirm the use of further barges in the coming months but they have struggled to find ports prepared to host them so far. A site next to London City airport and another on the River Mersey in Wirral among those being rejected. However, the government believes a successful scheme in Dorset will help encourage other areas to sign up. It said there were currently about 51,000 ""destitute migrants"" in hotels across the UK, costing the taxpayer more than £6m a day. The Home Office said its plans for alternative accommodation - including two more barges and three ex-military bases in East Sussex, Essex and Lincolnshire - offered better value. However, the full costs of the barge have not been disclosed, with refugee campaign group Reclaim The Sea claiming the Bibby Stockholm would cost more than hotels
  The vessel - chartered for an initial 18-month trial - includes catering, a TV room, a multi-faith prayer room and a gym. Migrants will be free to leave on hourly buses to Weymouth and Portland, although they are encouraged to return by 23:00 each night. The Home Office has said the barge occupants will undergo security screening and Dorset Police has said it does not expect any impact. Dorset Council is receiving £3,500 per occupied bedspace on the barge, with additional funding provided to the local NHS and police. The council has also received almost £380,000 in a one-off grant to help support local charity and voluntary organisations provide services, it is understood. The Labour Party has been repeatedly pressed on whether it would continue to use the barge to house asylum seekers if it was in power.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} MPs who came up with a blueprint for reducing the number of migrants arriving lawfully into the UK have insisted they are loyal to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” Ms Cates questioned the decision to keep care workers on the occupation shortage list, a designation that allows the sector to bring lower-skilled workers into the country to fill positions, suggesting it was a Covid policy that had not delivered. She said the country had “record levels of migration, and we’ve still not solved the care crisis”, with Ms Cates instead arguing that the solution was to “train up our own people to do the work” and “improve the pay conditions so that people want to do it”. Mr Kruger said the group, along with his party, were rallying against the “establishment” when it came to migration reforms. “There is an establishment in this country, which the Conservative leadership and our colleagues here are not part of, and that is the establishment that we’re fighting against, that resists these proposals, particularly on immigration,” he said. Downing Street said the Government had no plan to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list and downplayed the prospect of blocking foreign university students from staying in the UK after graduation – another recommendation made by the New Conservatives group. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to say whether Mr Sunak was frustrated by Mr Anderson’s support for tougher migration rules but acknowledged there were “different views on each side”. Home Secretary Suella Braverman faced a question from Tory MP James Daly in the Commons about raising the main skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 per annum, a recommendation made in Mr Hunt’s report.

Last month in the House of Lords, Mr Clarke backed the “extraordinary” small boats law and has reconfirmed his position as the Illegal Migration Bill is set for its third reading on Monday afternoon. Everyone knows that it is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here. Ken Clark Writing in The Telegraph, Mr Clarke said while he has advocated the benefits that migrants bring to Britain, “doing nothing about illegal immigration is not an option”. HE SAID: “IMPORTANTLY, IN ALL THE DEBATE ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT’S ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, NO ONE HAS ADVANCED AN ALTERNATIVE. “I have listened keenly for an idea of how else we might deal with the mounting problem of irregular migration, but answer has come there none.” The flagship legislation passed through the House of Commons but has met fierce opposition in the Lords. It aims to ensure those who arrive in the UK without permission will be detained and promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda. Mr Clarke said he is not making his comments out of “slavish loyalty” and he has not always been an admirer of the Government. But he lauded the Government’s approach to welcoming in Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong. He said: “We are not becoming a walled-in, closed country. That is a good British contribution to a tremendous problem for the whole of the Western World. “Everyone knows that (illegal migration) is a huge problem, and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the Channel in considerable numbers by taking risks as they come here.” It comes as 1,070 migrants crossed the Channel in 13 boats on Friday and in seven boats on Saturday, according to Home Office figures. That takes the provisional total for the year so far to over 12,500 people. Home Secretary Suella Braverman has been fighting to get her central policy of forcibly removing unauthorised arrivals to Rwanda off the ground after it was blocked by appeal judges. The Government has lodged a bid to take its legal battle to the Supreme Court.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ken-clarke-channel-home-office-government-house-of-lords-b2372268.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20241209174803/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ken-clarke-channel-home-office-government-house-of-lords-b2372268.html

Ascension Island is among the territories being re-evaluated as a place to process asylum seekers – in case the government’s Rwanda policy is ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, The Times has reported. The government is also reportedly in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation agreement to the one agreed with Rwanda. LABOUR’S SHADOW HOME SECRETARY, YVETTE COOPER, CONDEMNED THE PLANS AS “HEADLINE CHASING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE NEVER DELIVERED”. Asylum seekers sent to these territories would not be able to remain there permanently. The success of the proposal would rely on the government being able to relocate migrants to another destination – such as their home country or a third party country – after their claims are processed. Previous plans to send illegal migrants to Ascension Island, revealed in 2020 under Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s tenure, were branded a “logistical nightmare” by a member of the island’s council, Alan Nicholls. A feasibility study carried out by the Foreign Office found the volcanic island, with a population of 900, was “unlivable” for reasons such as inadequate water supplies, and a lack of medical infrastructure. The government’s Rwanda plan ran into legal roadblocks after the Court of Appeal found it was “unlawful”, citing deficiencies in the East African country’s asylum system. A senior government source told The Times that it was “pragmatic to consider all options” including sending illegal migrants to overseas territories such as Ascension Island. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, condemned these proposals as “more shameful demonisation of men, women and children” escaping countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iran. Labour’s Yvette Cooper told the paper: “They claimed they were going to do this years ago but it never got off the ground. This joins a long list of headline chasing announcements that are never delivered.” Campaigners have raised concerns about the safety of people deported to Rwanda (PA) (PA Wire) The government is also considering significantly increasing fines for employers and landlords who allow unauthorised migrants to work for them or live in their properties, under their plans to deter Channel crossings. The Home Office argued that “illegal working and renting are significant pull factors for migrants crossing the Channel” and that increasing fines will serve as a deterrent. Civil penalties for employers will be increased up to a maximum of £45,000 per worker for a first breach and £60,000 for repeat offenders, tripling both from the last increase in 2014. These hikes are expected to be enforced from the beginning of next year, after the laws are altered this autumn. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said: “Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue.” “There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties,” he added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230807065633/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-illegal-migrants-ascension-island-rwanda-b2388582.html

I’m asking largely about healthy young people, albeit exhausted ones. Migrants, who have braved long, terrible journeys, often experiencing horrific violence and terror. So how many should we write off as justifiable collateral damage in our war against … what, exactly? There is no war except with ourselves: it’s a culture war. The cause is “strong borders”, but strong against what? Despite the rhetoric, this not an invasion. If the strong borders are to protect our economy – well, these are young, fit workers who could boost our economies if we actually let them work. The question of what number of deaths is acceptable is pertinent because we are actively pursuing policies that increase these avoidable deaths. So far this year, more than 2,000 people are estimated to have drowned in the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach European shores. About 650 people died when a single overcrowded boat sank off Greece in June. Just 104 were rescued. This month, 41 passengers died off the coast of Italy, 63 perished trying to reach Spain, and at least six people died in the Channel off the French coast, while trying to reach Britain in a small boat. The number of deaths rises as we normalise them. Will we reach a point of revulsion, where the public can no longer tolerate such tragedy, or will such a threshold rise with the deaths and the diminishment of our humanity? It is almost exactly eight years since the image of a drowned toddler washed up on a Mediterranean beach shocked the world into compassion. Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old, escaping war in Syria, had been attempting to reach Europe with his family when their small boat capsized on 2 September 2015. But the humane speeches from leaders proved a temporary reaction and, although the number of refugees seeking safety in Europe has fallen far below those at the height of the Syrian conflict, border policies have hardened and leaders have grown ever more hostile in speech and actions. We have allowed the political discussion around migration to be dominated by populist party sloganeering and driven by the sales agenda of tabloids with confected campaign stories. It has resulted in a swath of brutal and costly policies in Europe and north Africa, where people at their most vulnerable are tormented with impunity – and in no safe routes. IN THE UK, WHERE MISMANAGED AND DELAYED PROCESSING OF ASYLUM CLAIMS HAS CREATED A BACKLOG OF MORE THAN 136,000 APPLICANTS WHO ARE FORBIDDEN TO WORK, HOTEL HOUSING COSTS ARE RUNNING AT ABOUT £2.3BN A YEAR. Thus riled by his government’s failures, Sunak has declared war on asylum seekers with a barrage of measures from the cruel to the unworkable to the ridiculous. These include last month’s drastic Illegal Migration Act, which torches the universal right of any human from anywhere to seek safety somewhere else on Earth (if that somewhere is Britain), and immigration minister Robert Jenrick’s petty removal of comforting cartoon murals at a detention centres holding traumatised children. ‘By the end of Sunak’s special week, the Bibby Stockholm’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated, owing to the risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease.’ Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images Sunak’s “small boats week” was not a community-awareness event marked by bake sales and fun runs in support of refugees and the RNLI. Instead, there was talk of sending migrants to Ascension Island, a remote rock in the middle of the Atlantic (even more ludicrous than the Rwanda plan), and the spectacle of a serving senior MP, a Conservative party deputy chair, telling asylum seekers to “fuck off back to France”. Meanwhile, the government pushed ahead with its plans to incarcerate a few hundred people – roughly 1% of those waiting for claim processing – on a densely packed barge off the south coast, despite expert warnings of fire and disease risk and, even more unforgivably, despite the discovery of legionella bacteria in water samples. By the end of Sunak’s special week, the barge’s poor inmates were being hurriedly evacuated again, owing to the undeniably high risk of deadly legionnaires’ disease. This is performative politics, it is not leadership worthy of this nation, it is not governance fit for this time of true global crises. When will we look pragmatically at human movement and discuss a workable plan to manage it sustainably? The number of people moving across the world is only going to increase in coming decades, owing to population expansion and global warming, contributing to conflicts, disasters and food shortages that push people from their homes. By one estimate, there are more than 110 armed conflicts going on around the world and yet, in the UK, we receive a tiny proportion of asylum seekers per citizen compared with EU nations, let alone internationally. This is not an immigration crisis – but in the coming decades, it very much could be if we don’t plan today. This year, we’ve seen a taste of the climate chaos that will only worsen, with fires, floods, hurricanes and heat affecting nations on every continent displacing millions of people. In six years, some 2 billion people could be living in places where average temperatures exceed 29C; by the end of the century, this number approaches 4 billion. This summer, traumatised British refugees arriving in small boats from the wildfires in Rhodes were treated with kindness and generosity by Greek communities when they landed. They were lucky enough to have the papers (and skin colour) to receive asylum. It is in all of our interests to prevent a climate apartheid of safety on our shared planet. Even if we in the UK are not directly affected by extreme conditions, as holidaymakers or residents, we are, by extension, through our globalised human network. For instance, about half of our food is grown overseas, much of it in highly vulnerable areas, thus increasing prices. As conditions become too extreme, people will have to move. So too will capital, expertise, production, industry … everything will shift in response. The number is not fixed, and we still have plenty of choices. If we want fewer people to move, we need to fund places to adapt, and to rapidly speed our decarbonisation so the push factors aren’t worse. But inevitably people will move. We need an honest discussion about how we manage this movement, in our cities, nationally, and in collaboration with neighbouring nations – most of which are, like Britain, facing a shrinking labour force. This must be a moment of decision. Do we plan a workable way forward, adapting our border policies to accommodate the reality of this movement? Or do we decide that mass drownings of healthy young people are just fine?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/rising-migration-mass-drownings-culture-wars

According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee. She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees. And when a complaint was made against her, it was investigated by her sister Sarah Wing – a fellow trustee. This was 'in breach of the complaints policy' and the charity 'failed to identify or manage the conflict of interest and/or loyalty which arose', the commission said. Since at least early 2020, Care4Calais did not have the required three trustees but the exact date could not be established as proper records were not kept. According to a Charity Commission report on Care4Calais, the organisation which delivers aid to migrant camps, had an 'unhealthy reliance' on Clare Moseley and there was 'inappropriate blurring of the lines' as she served as both chief executive and a trustee She 'dominated' Care4Calais and went 'unchallenged for some time', controlling its finances and even having £340,000 paid into her personal bank account in an attempt to save money on foreign exchange fees The 53-year-old, who first hit the headlines when she had a relationship with a Tunisian migrant, quit Care4Calais this year amid allegations she had used pepper spray on a refugee in self-defence and threatened to drag a female volunteer out of a room 'by the f****** hair'. But today's findings reveal that she in fact stepped down in a row over who should hold the power when a new board was appointed to turn the charity around. Orlando Fraser KC, chairman of the Charity Commission, said: 'Our inquiry found that, over a significant period of time, and following a rapid expansion of its operations, Care4Calais was not managed well. 'ITS FUNDS WERE PUT AT RISK, AND THERE WAS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND/OR MISMANAGEMENT BY THE FORMER TRUSTEES.' But he added that the watchdog's intervention had led to 'significant improvements' with new leadership. The report gave Care4Calais the green light to continue opposing the Government's flagship policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. It found some 'deficiencies in relation to risk assessments and the reporting of incidents for its Calais based operations'. But the charity insisted 'it does not support, encourage, or facilitate illegal border crossings'. The commission has 'advised the charity to make this explicitly clear in all its policies and procedures and training materials for staff and volunteers'. Care4Calais charity with donations ready to hand out to migrants in France Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: 'The Charity Commission finding serious misconduct at Care4Calais is concerning but not particularly surprising. 'As with certain immigration lawyers, it's clear that some charities and civil society groups are actively undermining efforts to curb illegal migration. 'They form part of an establishment committed to ever increasing migration, with no regard for the will of the British people. 'These groups are comprised of politically motivated activists masquerading as 'humanitarians'. It is a con. But the British public won't be fooled.' Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson branded Care4Calais a 'shambles' and an 'embarrassing stain on the record of real charities'. New chief executive Steve Smith insisted their new board of trustees 'have taken the criticisms of previous governance shortcomings seriously, and are dedicated to learning from the past'. Last night Ms Moseley said in a statement: 'I am proud to have worked many long hours as an unpaid volunteer to grow Care4Calais from a grassroots project to a charity that now has a £2million turnover and over £1million in assets. I always followed the advice of our lawyers, accountants and auditors in the running of Care4Calais.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12437933/Watchdog-blasts-controversial-refugee-charity-Care4Calais-misconduct-involving-disgraced-founder-affair-Tunisian-migrant-pepper-sprayed-asylum-seeker-threatened-drag-female-volunteer-f-g-hair.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

The New Conservatives group of backbenchers wants to reduce the number of study visas by around 75,000 by excluding the worst universities from eligibility. 1 Tory MPs say slashing immigration must not be compromised to prop up universities Credit: Alamy It is among 12 demands they are making to Rishi Sunak in a new report which they believe will reduce net migration by 400,000. Asked about the hit to university coffers, author Tom Hunt MP said: “I don’t think we should be massively distorting our immigration policy to prop up the finances of many universities, many which have actually failed to provide the country with the skills it needs.” He added that “too many people” have gone to university in recent years and there needs to be a shift to technical skills”. The hardline Tories also want Suella Braverman to go further in clamping down on students’ families coming to Britain, extending the ban to masters’ students on one-year research courses. And they say graduates should only be allowed to stay if they have a job offer. They want to end the “addiction” to cheap foreign labour and get the 5million Brits on out of work benefits filling vacancies. Mr Hunt, a former radish picker, said “no job should be beneath anyone”. Yesterday the 25-strong New Conservatives insisted they were not “rebels” and fully supported the PM. Tory Party deputy Lee Anderson fuelled speculation he had been reined in by No10 after pulling out of the event at the last minute - but later claimed to be sick. But the caucus warned Mr Sunak would lose the next election if he “kicked the can” of immigration down the road. Red Wall MP Miriam Cates said failing to keep numbers down “raises deep concerns about national and cultural security”. She said: “Particularly in towns and cities, a huge volume of immigration over over the last 10 years particularly, those of course, change the culture in society very significantly.” Hitting back at critics, Mr Hunt said it was “disparaging to label people xenophobes” for voicing fears about migration. Bury MP James Daly said immigration is the biggest issue to his voters “by a million miles”. AND DANNY KRUGER SAID HIS CABAL WERE RALLYING AGAINST THE “ESTABLISHMENT” ON MIGRATION REFORMS. The PM’s spokesman said: “We have to strike the right balance between tackling net migration and ensuring we have the right style to match the needs of the public.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/,http://web.archive.org/web/20230711205606/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22912345/slashing-immigration-must-come-before-unis/

But the first-year international business student was horrified when, with no prior warning, she was told the bombshell news that her tenancy contract had been cancelled - just weeks before the start of term. Devastated Ellie was left in a state of panic as she and scores of other students scrambled to find last-minute replacement accommodation, in a fiasco branded a 'total mess' by Huddersfield's MP.

She only managed to find a new place to live outside of Huddersfield yesterday - with just days to go before she starts her course on September 18. She added: 'It was a real rush. It’s not how I wanted to start the year. It’s shame. I just we would have been told a bit more about why our contracts were cancelled. We were left in the dark.’ Speaking about migrants taking over the tower block, she added: ‘I get why they’re doing this – they're doing it to better their lives. But it’s a real inconvenience for students. There have to be other places they can do this.' The situation outraged Labour MP for Huddersfield Barry Sheerman. He told MailOnline: 'It's a total mess. There was pressure at one stage back in the day for universities to recognise they were education experts but not residential experts. 'A lot of universities sold all their accommodation to the private sector... Because of that now what seems to have transpired is that these guys have said, ""oh this is nice, we get more money if we put asylum seekers in"". 'Quite ruthlessly, they have dumped students who have built all their hopes and plans on these rather nice residences they thought they were going to get.' The 18-year-old from Thirsk, North Yorkshire, had been planning for months to move into the 405-bed lavish halls, which has its own gym, cinema room and where top-end rooms can cost £200 a month to rent. Dozens of students now just have weeks to find new digs in Huddersfield after the bombshell news was dropped. The block includes its own cinema room To help with the house the new arrivals, the Home Office bought the HD1 block at Huddersfield, West Yorkshire - which comes with its own gym (pictured as an artist impression) and games room Plans to move hundreds of asylum seekers into a 405-bed HD1 tower in Huddersfield, which has a cinema room and gym and where top-end studio flats can cost £200 a week, have outraged Labour MP Barry Sheerman (pictured) Mr Sheerman said university vice chancellors were 'wringing their hands' about what had happened. 'Everybody is washing their hands and saying ''not my fault guv'',' he added. Mr Sheerman, who previously chaired the Commons Education Committee, said he had three grandchildren at university and young people were already enduring a 'really tough time' with high costs and the impact of Covid. 'The government has got to get a grip on this... the Office for Students isn't fit for purpose,' he said. Mr Sheerman said the Home Office had to be held responsible for taking the accommodation meant for students. 'We do have something called Cabinet government. Presumably the Home Secretary does speak to her colleagues in the education department,' he said. He added: 'I have deep sympathy for students being given an appalling deal by the system. 'At the end of the day the buck has to stop with the ministers responsible.' No students were living in the tower block prior to the arrangement having been reached. The HD1 student halls, only a short walk from the University of Huddersfield campus, in West Yorkshire, was previously advertised as 'luxury student accommodation'. Rooms were available to rent for from between £135 and £200 a week, with student facilities including a games room, pool table, cinema, gym and a washing room. More than 20,000 migrants arrived in the UK this year (pictured are migrants reaching the UK on Tuesday) The HD1 block has 405 beds - with 168 students who had reportedly signed on to live there having now been refunded (pictured is an example of a study area in one room) News of the deal comes after 300 migrants made the perilous Channel crossing in small boats on Tuesday - taking the total number of illegal arrivals reaching this UK this year to 20,000. Prestige Student Living (PSL), the lettings company, claimed landlord Hudd Student Management had told them the block would not be opening to students. The block had previously been unoccupied over the summer. So far, 168 students, due to be living in the halls, have now been refunded. In a statement, PSL told MailOnline: 'Hudd Student Management, the landlord for HD1, informed us that the building will not be opening to students in September. This decision is beyond the control of Prestige Student Living. 'Our team took immediate action to inform students and help them secure alternative accommodation in Huddersfield and return all payments made to us. 'We deeply sympathise with the students affected by the news and will do all we can to support them. 'Our agreement with the Hudd Student Management has terminated with immediate effect.' The news outraged Labour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock who told LBC students were 'paying the price for the Government's reliance on emergency accommodation'. Nick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, added he was 'genuinely shocked' by the news. Some of the boutique rooms boast having views of the canals in Huddersfield (pictured is an example of one of the bedrooms on offer) The halls are kitted out with their own kitchen and bathroom (pictured is an impression of the room, used of in official marketing material online) 'It's one thing for the Home Office to block-book an empty hall of residence that is brand new or empty but to let students down like this just before term starts seems pretty outrageous – especially when Huddersfield was identified earlier this week as an amber risk in terms of a shortage of student beds,' he told the Telegraph. He added the Home Office and landlords had a 'moral duty' to help the students but claimed that university accommodation is 'not generally taken as seriously in Whitehall' as other types of housing. A spokesman for Huddersfield University said: 'Huddersfield has sufficient student accommodation to meet the needs of our students and there are current vacancies available. For any students affected by this, who have not already been re-housed, please contact: hudlets@hud.ac.uk ' The Home Office said Britain was facing a huge demand from asylum seekers crossing the Channel. In a statement, a spokeswoman added: 'We have always been upfront about the unprecedented pressure being put on our asylum system, brought about by a significant increase in dangerous and illegal journeys into the country. 'We continue to work across government and with local authorities to identify a range of accommodation options. The government remains committed to engaging with local authorities and key stakeholders as part of this process.' Do you know one of the students affected at Huddersfield?

Ms Braverman has said as a barrister of seven years, she knows lawyers are entitled and obliged to find “any credible legal angle that gets the best result for their client”. However, she warned: “They are not allowed to lie. NOR ARE THEY ALLOWED TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO LIE”. She described the undercover expose by the Mail as “extremely shocking”. The Homes Secretary said not only are the revelations “appalling and irresponsible”, but they are also “potential criminal”. Ms Braverman slammed Labour for cheering on the Government's opponents She added it shows why it has been “so hard for the Government to remove people with no right to be here - and why we were right to change the law to curb spurious challenges to removal”. “We know that the majority of lawyers are professional practitioners, but we also know there are some lawyers who are ideologically opposed to illegal-migration controls. “They have said so, proudly.” Ms Braverman’s damning words come after Rishi Sunak blasted Labour for being on the side of lawyers and people smugglers in wanting to keep Britain’s borders wide open. The Prime Minister said the Mail’s expose demonstrated “what we’re up against”, and blasted Sir Keir for “propping up a system of exploitation that profits from getting people to the UK illegally”.

The regulator pledged to take 'urgent action' after our undercover expose found staff at some law firms were charging up to £10,000 to invent stories of torture, death threats and modern slavery designed to help clients apply for refugee status. Rishi Sunak and Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk said the allegations of 'appalling' conduct must be met with the 'full force of sanctions'. Politicians from across the political spectrum, including shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry and Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael have also called for the legal authorities to investigate. Posing as an economic migrant who had arrived in the UK illegally, our reporter found legal staff readily offering to help him submit false asylum claims, in apparent contravention of the solicitors' code of conduct. One legal adviser even offered to supply the reporter with antidepressants to show to the Home Office to support false claims that he was traumatised. Pictured: Muhammad Azfar from Kingswright Solicitors who suggested a marriage ploy to client Lawyer Vinnasythamby Lingajothy (pictured) offered to invent a horrific back story of torture, beatings, slave labour and death threats for an asylum application In a statement, the Solicitors Regulation Authority said: 'We can confirm we are investigating the firms/individuals. As a result of the information provided, we are looking to take urgent action to make sure the public are protected. At last, BBC reports our story The BBC finally reported the Mail's investigation into rogue immigration solicitors two days after it was first published. This newspaper's revelations on Tuesday prompted a furious response from the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and leading Labour politicians. But the BBC didn't report the findings until the early hours of yesterday morning in an online article, and a few hours later on Radio 4's Today Programme. In the article – which linked to our story in MailOnline – the broadcaster quoted the Justice Secretary Alex Chalk urging the Solicitors Regulation Authority to use the 'full force of sanctions' at its disposal. 'Solicitors are critical to the operation of a fair immigration system. I know that the overwhelming majority take their professional duties and obligations extremely seriously,' Mr Chalk KC wrote in a letter to the SRA. The article also quoted Mr Sunak, who praised the Mail's work in uncovering the 'truly shocking' behaviour. The PM said: 'It is vital that those found to be abusing their position face the full consequences of their actions.' Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> 'If we find evidence that solicitors or firms we regulate have acted in ways that contravene our rules, and in particular their duty to act legally and uphold the law, we can and will take action.' MR SUNAK SAID THIS WEEK THAT THE 'EXPLOITATION AND UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICE' OF ROGUE LAWYERS BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY THE MAIL WERE 'TRULY SHOCKING'. In a letter to SRA chairman Anna Bradley, Mr Chalk said 'robust' action was needed to retain public confidence in the immigration system. The SRA has the power to levy substantial fines and even shut down law firms with immediate effect. It can also refer rogue lawyers to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, which can levy unlimited fines and strike off solicitors, leaving them unable to practise. The Mail covertly visited a string of law firms with a reporter posing as an Indian national who had arrived in the UK illegally on a small boat to look for work. Muhammad Azfar Ahmad, a lawyer at Kingswright Solicitors in Birmingham, said getting married to a British citizen or someone with indefinite leave to remain would be a 'better thing' than pursuing a difficult-to-win asylum claim. Separately, Rashid Ahmad Khan, a lawyer with Rashid and Rashid Solicitors in Merton, south-west London, told our undercover reporter to write down the reasons why he was no longer safe in India just minutes after being told there were none, adding: 'You write one page I'll turn it into four pages.' Legal representative Vinnasythamby Lingajothy, representing Duncan Ellis Solicitors in south London, offered to invent a horrific back story of torture, beatings, slave labour and death threats for an asylum application – in return for a fee of £10,000. The law firm said it had sacked him. Convictions for people smuggling have fallen 36 per cent since 2010, according to research published by Labour. It showed 253 individuals were convicted last year, compared to 398 back in 2010.

The swift response came after Rishi Sunak and Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk had said the allegations of 'appalling' conduct must be met with the 'full force of sanctions'. Home Secretary Suella Braverman, Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry and Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael were among politicians from all parties that had also called for the legal authorities to investigate. In a response to a letter from the Lord Chancellor, Anna Bradley, chairman of the Solicitors Regulation Authority board, said she had been 'shocked' by the apparent behaviour of those solicitors identified by the Mail.

She said the SRA has also made an order against a non-regulated person working at a further firm which stops him 'working with or for' any SRA regulated firm. The watchdog has also started an 'urgent on-site inspection' of two of the firms involved to 'gather further evidence' and was in talks with other enforcement agencies to 'co-ordinate our actions', she said. And Ms Bradley said the regulator was also launching a 'wider inspection of the immigration sector' to examine compliance with its new guidance. 'This will commence in the next few weeks and will include a cross section of firms working in the asylum sector and take into account the issues raised by the Daily Mail investigation.' The SRA would also be 'expanding and promoting the information' on our rules and best practice we have available to law firms, she said. 'This will include new guidance that will take account of the serious issues raised by the Daily Mail investigation and will ensure that solicitors are aware of their professional obligations.' In the letter, she added: 'We very much agree that public trust and confidence is fundamental to a strong and healthy legal profession and, like you, we were shocked by the apparent behaviour of those solicitors identified by the Daily Mail recently. The swift response came after Rishi Sunak (pictured) and Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk had said the allegations of 'appalling' conduct must be met with the 'full force of sanctions' 'As you acknowledge in your letter, solicitors play an important role in our society and the vast majority behave in an appropriate and professional manner, providing high quality, much needed advice and assistance to their clients. 'However, in areas of law where the consequences for clients are so severe, such as in immigration services, these high standards are even more critical.' She added that 'due process must be followed' and fairness for all involved was paramount. Our damning investigation, using a reporter posing as an economic migrant who had arrived in the UK illegally, found legal staff readily offering to help him submit false asylum claims, in apparent contravention of the solicitors' code of conduct. One legal adviser even offered to supply the reporter antidepressant medication to show the Home Office as 'evidence' that he was traumatised. At another firm, a lawyer said he would have to 'create the evidence' to make it appear the reporter had a genuine fear of 'persecution and assassination' if he returned home. THE SRA HAS THE POWER TO LEVY SUBSTANTIAL FINES AND EVEN SHUT DOWN LAW FIRMS WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT. Crucially, it can also refer rogue lawyers to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, which can levy unlimited fines and strike off solicitors, leaving them unable to practise. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she suspected that the Mail's findings were the 'tip of the iceberg' and warned that some of the practices went beyond potential professional sanctions and were 'potentially criminal.' However, a loophole in the law means that while migrants can face criminal sanctions for submitting false claims, it is much harder to prosecute their lawyers.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12357485/Shut-Solicitors-watchdog-dramatically-closes-three-legal-firms-caught-offering-submit-false-asylum-claims-thousands-pounds-following-Mail-expos.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12357485/Shut-Solicitors-watchdog-dramatically-closes-three-legal-firms-caught-offering-submit-false-asylum-claims-thousands-pounds-following-Mail-expos.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Speaking on Sunday Stephen Kinnock said his party would be ""forced to"" put people on the ships for a limited period of time, perhaps six months. Mr Kinnock said his party agreed with the government that asylum seekers should be moved out of hotel accommodation – the driving force behind Suella Braverman's push to house them on ships and in military camps. The Home Office has scrambled to find alternatives to hotels amid criticism in the media and concerns over the cost of booking out the accommodation – but alternatives have faced criticism from rights groups for being ""inhumane"". ""The reality is that we've got tens of thousands of people in hotels, we need to get them out of hotels and we need to get them off the barges and out of the military camps too,"" Mr Kinnock told BBC Breakfast. ""Because of the complete and utter chaos and shambles of the Tory asylum crisis, we are going to have to continue in a very short-term period to use the infrastructure that is there, including the barges and the hotels."" At the end of July the Home Office was forced to delay its plan to move people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge to carry out last-minute safety checks. It came after more 50 organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, and Asylum Matters called the government's plan for the floating accommodation “cruel and inhumane”. But speaking on Sunday, Mr Kinnock said: ""We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. ""I'm confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.""

The Opposition accused Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman of overseeing “complete chaos” as Home Office data showed a record 175,000 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of June. The figure is up 44% from a year earlier and the highest since current records began in 2010. The record high asylum backlog is having a devastating impact on the people we work with Enver Solomon, Refugee Council Campaigners blamed Government policy for leaving people “languishing in limbo and unsafe accommodation”, and warned it is “causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives”. The data, which also shows 80% of people have been waiting longer than six months for an initial decision on their claim, piles further pressure on Mr Sunak, who has made tackling small boat Channel crossings one of his top five priorities. Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: “These new statistics set out in stark terms the complete chaos the Tories have created in the immigration and asylum system. “With this level of mismanagement, there is very little prospect of reducing the eye-wateringly high bill for hotel rooms for all those left in limbo, currently costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day.” Ministers hope to accommodate migrants on the Bibby Stockholm barge despite a series of setbacks (John Gurd/PA) Ministers are looking to house migrants on former military bases and a barge to reduce the expense of accommodating them in hotels. Freedom from Torture’s associate director Natasha Tsangarides said: “This is a crisis of the Government’s own making. The huge backlog of asylum claims is the result of over a decade of policy failures, mismanagement, and systemic neglect that has left over 175,000 people – over a third more than last year – languishing in limbo and unsafe accommodation. “Rather than pushing cruel and draconian measures aimed at punishing refugees, this Government must rebuild a fair and efficient asylum system and urgently expand safe routes to the UK.” She also noted that Home Office statistics showing that just over seven in 10 of initial decisions in the year to June were grants of refugee status “disprove the Government’s toxic narrative” as they left “no doubt that most people reaching our shores are refugees – men, women, and children fleeing the most unimaginable horrors”. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said: “The record high asylum backlog is having a devastating impact on the people we work with, whose lives are put on hold indefinitely while they anxiously wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay in the UK.” The Home Office's approach to the asylum backlog could push people underground.

The Institute for Public Policy Research also called the alarm bells over withdrawals, which made up 47% of all initial asylum decisions. Marley Morris, associate director for migration, trade and communities, said: “In the long run, this could backfire on the Government, as people whose applications are withdrawn end up being pushed underground or make fresh asylum claims.” The British Red Cross also said the Government must “urgently review its efforts to reduce the backlog and publish data on why vulnerable people’s claims are being withdrawn”. It is “deeply concerned” about the “toll” being stuck in the asylum backlog “for months or even years” takes on people’s physical and mental health. (PA Graphics) Rachel Goodall, head of asylum services at Refugee Action, said: “The huge backlog in asylum decision making is a product of the Government’s hostile environment and it is causing immense suffering to refugees who just want to get on with their lives. “It has forced thousands of people into inappropriate housing such as former hotels, prison ships and MoD (Ministry of Defence) sites from which only the private firms trousering millions in taxpayer-funded profits benefit.” The charity called for the Government to give asylum seekers leave to remain in the UK if they end up waiting more than a year for a decision on a claim.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman had previously said any migrants who arrived since March by 'irregular' routes – such as on dinghies across the Channel – would be barred from making asylum claims. But in a major concession to get the Government's Illegal Migration Bill through Parliament, it will now apply only to migrants who reach the UK after the legislation gains Royal Assent. Official figures show 9,622 migrants arrived on small boats between March 7 and Sunday. The Home Secretary's concession means they will now be able to claim asylum under existing rules – meaning many are likely to stay in Britain indefinitely. Official figures show 9,622 migrants arrived on small boats between March 7 and Sunday Mrs Braverman said: 'This Bill forms a crucial part of our action to stop the boats and ensure people do not risk their lives by making illegal and unnecessary journeys to the UK. Today's amendments will help this crucial legislation pass through Parliament swiftly, whilst continuing to send a clear message that the exploitation of children and vulnerable people, used by criminals and ferried across the Channel, cannot continue.' The Government's Bill suffered 20 defeats in the House of Lords as peers sought to water down its measures. It now faces a tortuous series of votes in the Commons as the Government seeks to erase peers' changes. If it passes the 'ping-pong' stage between the two Houses today and tomorrow, the Bill could gain Royal Assent – and become law – within days. In a further sop to the Lords, Mrs Braverman tabled further amendments which will increase safeguards around the detention of unaccompanied child migrants. If a child is detained for removal from Britain, an immigration judge will be able to grant bail after eight days instead of the previous proposal of 28 days. In a further concession, the Home Office will be able to detain pregnant women for a maximum of 72 hours, extendable to seven days on a ministers' authorisation. Migrants who arrived since March 7 will still face bans on re-entering the UK and will be excluded from gaining settlement or citizenship in this country. Migrants who arrived since March 7 will still face bans on re-entering the UK and will be excluded from gaining settlement or citizenship in this country The Home Office confirmed that 269 migrants reached Britain across the Channel on Sunday, bringing the total so far this year to 12,772, compared with 13,286 at the same point last year.

Mr Sunak wore heavy boots and a stab vest as he joined officers on the raid in Brent, north west London, early on Thursday morning. IT COMES AFTER HE PROMISED TO ABOLISH THE BACKLOG OF AROUND 92,000 ASYLUM CLAIMS BY THE END OF 2023. However, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs on Wednesday that the target will not be met at the “current pace”. Asked after the raid about Ms Braverman’s comments, Mr Sunak said: “It was good to be out this morning with our immigration enforcement team and seeing first-hand their work to tackle illegal working. “That’s an important strand of our work, to stop the boats and tackle illegal migration. “And that’s because the criminal gangs use a business model that tempts people here with the offer of black market work. “It’s not right, which is why we’ve increased resources for immigration enforcement. “We’ve increased the number of raids like the one I was on this morning by 50% and we’ve doubled the number of arrests.” He added: “But we’re not complacent. “There’s lots of work to do, which is why it’s so important that we pass our Bill through Parliament, our Stop The Boats Bill, which will mean that if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay. “We will be able to detain you and then swiftly remove you.” Not long after Mr Sunak returned from the raid, Ms Braverman met French interior minister Gerald Darmanin in London.

Mr Robinson was interviewing the immigration minister on Wednesday's edition of the Today programme when he raised recent comments made by Lee Anderson. Mr Anderson had earlier reacted to complaints about the use of the new barge to accommodate asylum seekers by saying: 'If they don't like barges they should f*** off back to France'. But when the Today programme host raised the remarks with Robert Jenrick, he claimed Mr Anderson had said these people should 'F-off home'. Tory MPs were critical of the host's comments yesterday, with one saying Robinson sounded like he was 'talking for the metropolitan elites', while another said the BBC should not 'misquote people' or else it creates a sense of 'bias'. Nick Robinson (pictured) was interviewing the immigration minister on Wednesday's edition of the Today programme when he raised recent comments made by Lee Anderson About an hour after the interview, the Today programme host clarified his earlier comments by admitting he had 'misquoted' the Tory party deputy chairman, this time giving the correct wording used in the interview that Mr Anderson, 56, had given to the Daily Express. On the programme Mr Robinson, 59, asked Mr Jenrick, 41: 'How carefully was the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party choosing his language when he suggested that asylum seekers, and I quote, should 'F-off home' except I'm cleaning up that quote by saying 'F—off'. MR JENRICK SAID 'WE ALL CHOOSE OUR OWN LANGUAGE' AND THAT ANDERSON HAD BEEN EXPRESSING THE 'DEEP FRUSTRATION' OF A LARGE PART OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC AT THE CURRENT SITUATION. Mr Robinson added: 'Well, he was expressing a prejudice, wasn't he? He was expressing a view that people who are trying to come here, who may well have a genuine claim, may well indeed be refugees, should, to quote, 'F—off home'. Conservative MP, Peter Bone, said: 'Lee Anderson spoke for the vast majority of my constituents and I agree with him entirely, that if illegal migrants come across in small boats to this country and don't want to be put on a barge – well don't come across in the first place. 'That's the point. Nobody's forcing them to come here. And many people I speak to actually think all illegal migrants that come across should be given a nice cup of tea and put on a ferry back to France. 'He is speaking for the nation, Nick Robinson, sounds to be talking for the metropolitan elites and it wouldn't be the first time that the BBC and the Today programme are out of touch with reality.' Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party Lee Anderson speaking during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons on July 19, 2023 Tory MP, Bill Cash, said: 'The BBC has an obligation to be accurate, they must therefore do the research properly, they must not misquote people and then create a clear evidence of bias.' Mr Robinson in 2021 had sparked anger from Tories after he told then Prime Minister Boris Johnson to 'stop talking' during an interview on the show. Then last year he came under fire from Conservative MPs over the way he had covered Johnson's apology to MPs for the Downing Street lockdown party, where he was accused of making a series of barbed comments.

One of the 'legal advisers' investigated, VP Lingajothy, explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded. He even offered to supply antidepressants and a friendly doctor to support evidence of 'psychological trauma'. ANOTHER, AS WE REVEAL TODAY, TOLD OUR UNDERCOVER REPORTER THAT THE TEDIOUS PROCESS OF CLAIMING ASYLUM WOULD BE MUCH ACCELERATED IF HE 'FOUND A GIRL' AND 'ARRANGED A MARRIAGE' — EVEN THOUGH GETTING MARRIED FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES IS ILLEGAL WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP IS BOGUS. The investigation paints a dispiriting picture of greed and corruption that shames the legal profession. It also exposes the flaws in Britain's immigration system, which is making a mockery of our human rights legislation and inevitably makes it harder for those genuinely fleeing persecution to find sanctuary here, and to win the public round to their cause. For let us not forget who the real victims are: the people who truly need our help but who — thanks to the work of rapacious vultures like Lingajothy clogging up the system with spurious asylum claims — may find their cases are left in limbo. It is shameful that they should face uncertainty while others simply buy their way in thanks to crooked lawyers. Image from undercover footage shows Vinnasythamby Lingajothy offering anti-depressant medication to an undercover reporter which he said the journalist could show the Home Office as evidence of his 'psychological trauma.' Given all that, you might have thought these revelations would have caused national uproar. That the story might be popping up on news bulletins and discussion shows, that charities supporting refugees would be making statements, that the great and the good of the liberal elite would be fizzing with righteous indignation. Well, in some respects they are. Only not as you might expect.

'The comments by the Prime Minister,' said Townend, 'are clearly an attempt to play politics with the legal profession. This damaging rhetoric undermines the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system and is to be deplored.' Er, no. What's actually 'undermining the rule of law, trust in lawyers and confidence in the UK legal system' is the scandalous behaviour of individuals such as Lingajothy. Indeed, the fact that Mr Townend even thinks such a statement might constitute an appropriate response only indicates the scale of the problem. But elsewhere . . . tumbleweed. At the time of writing, the BBC was leading on Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter. And on that website, not a peep from the usual suspects. Silent were Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was briefly suspended from his BBC presenting duties after he compared the Government's policy on asylum-seekers to Germany in the 1930s, as well as A.C. Grayling, that weird fox-killing Jolyon fellow, and all their cronies, normally so keen to unsheath their virtue-signalling swords in defence of asylum seekers. SARAH VINE: 'Yesterday's revelations that corrupt immigration lawyers are charging up to £10,000 to lodge fake asylum claims make for sobering reading' Why so? I mean, here we have a group of people growing rich (Lingajothy put his son through Eton) thanks to dodgy and possibly illegal asylum claims, thus making it harder for genuine refugees to start a new life in Britain. Isn't that about as low as is gets; arguably as low as the trafficking gangs who bring people to our shores in the first place? Where is the howl of rage from the Left? Where are David Lammy, Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer? Surely they can't all be washing their hair?

The liberal Left isn't interested in this sordid tale of corruption because it doesn't fit their narrative. The truth — that is to say the actual truth rather than the subjective, one-sided viewpoint that often passes for truth now — is what you might call 'inconvenient'. It doesn't chime with their worldview — which is that anyone who believes in controlled immigration is a nutter or a Nazi, and that immigration lawyers are courageous saints saving people's lives in defiance of the evil Tories. Instead, this story offers concrete proof of the opposite: that not all asylum-seekers are genuine; that corruption does exist; that people can and do lie and buy their way into Britain at the expense of real refugees; and that, as the Prime Minister himself has pointed out, ultimately the Government is right to try to crack down on illegal practices surrounding immigration. It also shows that the public, and in particular those often-vilified people who dare to express their concerns about uncontrolled migration — and are characterised by lofty liberals as knuckle-dragging grunts and bigots — might just have a point. Of course, there's nothing new in those who are driven by their own peculiar tribal ideologies turning a blind eye to awkward facts. Just look at the way Tom (now, preposterously, Lord) Watson persecuted the late Leon Brittan and Lord Bramall over ludicrous allegations of a Conservative 'paedophile ring' in Westminster. Or consider how the Rotherham grooming gangs were allowed to operate unchecked for years because the authorities were paralysed by political correctness. Those are just two random examples: there are countless others. People interpret the truth as it suits them, as we've seen with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex who, to garner sympathy for their cause, painted a picture of the Royal Family that may have been 'their' truth, but which certainly wasn't the whole truth. Recollections may vary, as a wise Queen once said. SARAH VINE: 'VP Lingajothy (pictured) explained how by concocting a horrifying tale of sexual torture, beatings, slave labour, false imprisonment and death threats, he would ensure his client's claim succeeded' But whereas before there were limits to how far the facts could be distorted before someone sensible stepped in, in a world dominated by social media — where accusations rarely have consequences and where facts are often indistinguishable from opinion — truth is no longer empirical. Reality is irrelevant: it's a matter of interpretation. We are, it seems, living in a post-truth world. ASYLUM CLAIM Q&A Who is entitled to claim asylum in the UK? Those unable to live safely in any part of their own country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other social, cultural, religious or political situation that puts them at risk. They must also have failed to get protection from authorities in their own country. Are solicitors allowed to submit an asylum claim they know to be false? No. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says its members must act with ‘honesty and integrity’ and not ‘mislead or attempt to mislead’ a court, tribunal or regulator. What are the legal penalties for fake asylum applications? Immigrants face two years in prison or being ordered out of the UK if they give false information on an asylum application. Solicitors do not face any criminal penalty but those found to be acting dishonestly could be struck off.

But if you're an opportunistic politician with all the backbone of a jellyfish (Starmer), then the answer is yes. It's also 'yes' if you're a convicted rapist who doesn't much fancy doing time in a man's prison: like 'Isla Bryson', aka Adam Graham, who was outrageously incarcerated for a time in a Scottish women's jail. Similarly, according to the BBC, Nigel Farage had his Coutts bank account shut down because he was broke, not because his political views didn't match those of the bank's Department of Woke. (Auntie and NatWest have since apologised for this fantasy.) Boris Johnson did not nearly die of Covid, despite ample evidence to the contrary and the testimony of the doctors and nurses who treated him, because it suits some people to believe it was all a stunt designed to manipulate the public. That's the claim of a documentary by arch-Remainer Marcus Ball, which also included an interview with Lineker. When told that Ball made this allegation, Lineker was clear that he did not endorse it and quickly distanced himself from the film, but not before he appeared in a (truly terrible) trailer for it. The issue applies to everything, from climate change to sex scandals. Are the wildfires in Rhodes the dawning of the Apocalypse — or did someone just fail to put out their barbecue? Your guess is as good as mine. These days, the right answer is whatever you believed already. But truth is not just important, it's sacred. Without truth there can be no trust, and without trust we exist in a heightened state of paranoia and anxiety. Which probably goes some way towards explaining the mental-health epidemic fuelled by social media. People no longer know who or what to believe, and it's slowly driving us all mad.

However, she warned: “They are not allowed to lie. Nor are they allowed to encourage others to lie”. SHE DESCRIBED THE UNDERCOVER EXPOSE BY THE MAIL AS “EXTREMELY SHOCKING”.

Ms Braverman slammed Labour for cheering on the Government's opponents She added it shows why it has been “so hard for the Government to remove people with no right to be here - and why we were right to change the law to curb spurious challenges to removal”. “We know that the majority of lawyers are professional practitioners, but we also know there are some lawyers who are ideologically opposed to illegal-migration controls. “They have said so, proudly.” Ms Braverman’s damning words come after Rishi Sunak blasted Labour for being on the side of lawyers and people smugglers in wanting to keep Britain’s borders wide open.

It will scrap previous rules where criminals could be granted citizenship if a certain number of years had passed since they finished their sentence - regardless of the type of crime.

Is it just referring to people who have some kind of social conscience? I don’t necessarily find being called woke an insult.' He has joined a swathe of other celebrities who describe being woke as a positive attribute, demonstrating a desire to introduce more empathy and less division into contentious issues.

But Labour is plotting to torpedo the plan with a wrecking amendment to keep Britain under the yolk of foreign judges for its borders policy. 2 Labour is plotting to block the Stop The Boats Bill from passing Credit: AP 2 Immigration minister Robert Jenrick says failing to stop the small boats is 'not an option' Credit: PA Tabled by Corbynista peer Shami Chakrabarti, Tories said the “meddlers charter” would let international courts block deportations to Rwanda forever. No10’s flagship Illegal Migration Bill is in Parliament this week where it faces a fierce battle of “ping pong” between the Commons and the Lords. Mr Jenrick told The Sun on Sunday that leftie lords and MPs should cease their war on the borders plan. He said: ‘’We must take the tough action necessary to stop the illegal, dangerous and unnecessary crossings, and restore fairness and order to our immigration system. “Inaction is not an option. And those that oppose our plan to Stop the Boats have put forward no alternative. “Those who oppose this Bill - like Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour and Lib Dem MPs and peers trying to block it - are showing contempt towards hard-working communities across the UK are unfairly affected by illegal migration in their day to day lives. “They have no plan - as always they only carp from the sidelines. “Every MP and peer now faces a very simple choice: side with the law-abiding British public and back our Stop the Boats Bill, or continue to side with the people smugglers and the law breakers.” The Bill returns to the Commons today. MPs pack up for summer on Thursday - giving No10 just four days to pass the law. Around a dozen Tory MPs - including former PM Theresa May - plan to rebel and back amendments on modern slavery and child migrants. Ringleader Tim Loughton said they “back the Bill” but “it has got to go through with safeguards”. But fellow Tory MP Marco Longhi told his Conservative colleagues to stop picking holes and give the Bill their full support. HE SAID: “ANY CONSERVATIVE REBELS SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR THAT IF THEY VOTE AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENT AND WITH THE LORDS THEY WOULD BE GOING AGAINST THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE, AND THEIR PRIME MINISTER, OVER PROPOSALS THAT WILL DETER PEOPLE FROM SIGNIFICANT HARM AND WILL THEN BREAK UP THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS’ BUSINESS MODEL. “The current system effectively supports smugglers’ dirty business.” But ministers have signalled there will be no more concessions as this risks watering down and undermining the Bill. Labour lords and MPs will vote against the law. A Tory source said: “The Chakrabati amendment is nothing more than a meddler’s charter, inviting leftie lawyers to use spurious international law arguments to block deportations to Rwanda. “MPs should see it for what it is - an underhand ploy from Starmer’s Labour Lords to scupper our plan to stop the boats that will only serve to help the exploitive smuggling gangs. “They should vote it down.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23070317/robert-jenrick-tackle-small-boats/,http://web.archive.org/web/20240512162633/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23070317/robert-jenrick-tackle-small-boats/

The former shadow home secretary later deleted her tweet, which was a reference to Tory MP Lee Anderson’s use of the f word about migrants. But it prompted indignation on social media, and some commentators called for Ms Abbott to face sanctions. Her tweet was branded “obscene” and “revolting”. Rishi Sunak has backed his deputy party chairman Mr Anderson, who said migrants who do not want to live on a barge should “f*** off back to France”. However, the prime minister’s decision has divided the Conservatives, some warning him against turning the Tories into the “even nastier party” and a lurch to the right. Mr Anderson has refused to apologise for his incendiary comments, made after a group of 20 migrants were granted a last-minute reprieve as the first group boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset.

Some people who did not remember that she had already been suspended from the Labour Party called for her to be suspended or sacked.

Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said: 'I think it's really important if you've got a big platform to try and use it for what you think is for the good and that's what I have always done and will continue to do.' Last night he called for more kindness in politics, saying it is currently 'aggressive and hateful'. He continued: 'I would ask you, what is ""woke""? Is it a bad thing? Is it just referring to people who have some kind of social conscience? I don’t necessarily find being called woke an insult.' He has joined a swathe of other celebrities who describe being woke as a positive attribute, demonstrating a desire to introduce more empathy and less division into contentious issues. After the presenter was taken off air, the BBC led by Tim Davie was forced to make a humiliating climbdown following a Match of the Day which saw just a few minutes of highlights from the Premier League, with no music, commentary or linking sequences. Lineker returned to screens the following weekend, along with the rest of the BBC's football team. He has since confessed he became emotional when he heard other presenters were refusing to replace him or appear on air in support, admitting to crying in the back of a taxi after he discovered co-hosts Ian Wright and Alan Shearer had declined to appear without him. Many employees at the BBC have to be politically neutral on social media under guidelines which apply to full-time members of staff. The BBC is said to be reviewing its policies in the wake of the Lineker scandal, but so far no changes have been announced. Human rights organisation Amnesty International previously called for Lineker to be able to speak out on refugees despite his opinions leading to accusations of BBC bias. The pundit recently came under fire from some sports fans after he defended Just Stop Oil's peaceful protest at this year's Wimbledon.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12374827/Outspoken-BBC-star-Gary-Lineker-claims-received-standing-ovation-M-S-days-suspended-tweet-comparing-Suellas-migrant-crackdown-Nazi-Germany-denies-preachy.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12374827/Outspoken-BBC-star-Gary-Lineker-claims-received-standing-ovation-M-S-days-suspended-tweet-comparing-Suellas-migrant-crackdown-Nazi-Germany-denies-preachy.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

However, more needs to be done to support the Albanian victims of people smuggling, especially women, the Home Affairs Select Committee said. In a report published on Monday focusing on Albania, the committee said there was no clear basis for the UK to accept thousands of asylum applications from Albanian citizens. It comes after migration data revealed more than a quarter of the 45,755 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2022 were Albanian, most of whom made an asylum claim. The number of Albanians making the channel crossing in small boats rose from 800 in 2021 to 12,301 last year. THE UK SHOULD LOOK AT HOW ACCESS TO WORK VISA SCHEMES CAN BE IMPROVED TO FILL OUR SKILLS OR STAFFING GAPS WHILE OFFERING ALBANIAN NATIONALS A ROUTE TO HIGHER INCOME, BENEFITING BOTH NATIONS LABOUR CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE DAME DIANA JOHNSON MP SAID: “SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL SUDDEN INCREASE IN ASYLUM CLAIMS FROM A SEEMINGLY PEACEFUL COUNTRY UNDERSTANDABLY RAISED CONCERNS. “While it is important that questions are asked and lessons are learnt, it is clear that the immigration picture is not static and will continue to evolve. “New challenges are likely to continue to emerge and it is important that the UK improves its overall approach to asylum, rather than focus on one country.” The committee said the main driver of migration from Albania was economic and recommended the Government promote seasonal work visas in agriculture and construction to give more Albanians the opportunity to come to the UK without making unauthorised channel crossings. The committee also said that while claims for political asylum “should not normally be entertained”, there are “unquestionably cases of Albanian citizens being trafficked to the UK”. It said appropriate safeguards must be in place before any victims of trafficking are returned to Albania and also recommended the UK maintain strong links with the country’s government. Dame Diana added: “Changes in migration will inevitably place strain on any system, but the Government must do much more to ensure it can better handle these stresses. “Most importantly, it must improve the speed of decision-making and clear the backlog as we set out in our Channel crossings report in 2022. We expect the Home Office to set out how it plans to achieve this. “People will continue to be attracted to the UK from Albania while it continues to offer job opportunities and higher wages. “The UK should look at how access to work visa schemes can be improved to fill our skills or staffing gaps while offering Albanian nationals a route to higher income, benefiting both nations.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/home-affairs-select-committee-albania-diana-johnson-mps-government-b1087061.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/home-affairs-select-committee-albania-diana-johnson-mps-government-b1087061.html

The first group of asylum seekers were moved on to the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland, Dorset, on Monday. Lawyers soon intervened to halt further transfers after claims the 220-bedroom vessel was unsafe and unsuitable for traumatised people. “If you decline the accommodation that’s provided, such as a barge, then we will consider removing your asylum support and that individual will ultimately have to fend for themselves,” Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. THE GOVERNMENT MEETS ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE ASYLUM SEEKERS WITH ACCOMMODATION AND BASIC NEEDS, SAID JENRICK, ADDING THAT THE RESPECTIVE HOTELS AND LOCATIONS ARE A “NO-CHOICE BASIS” AND NOT AN “A LA CARTE MENU”. The announcement is part of Rishi Sunak’s “small boats week”, during which the government is planning a series of eye-catching announcements responding to mounting pressure to remove asylum seekers from hotels. A rising backlog of asylum cases has not yet been processed by the Home Office, and the cost of hotel accommodation soared to £1.9bn last year. “We’re not making anybody destitute,” said Jenrick. “They would be choosing to do so because they wouldn’t accept the perfectly decent accommodation that’s provided.” The use of barges and former military bases to accommodate some asylum seekers has been met with alarm by refugee organisations for being costly, cruel and inhumane. Concerns have also been raised over fire safety, overcrowding and threats from the far right. “We shouldn’t need to be putting people up in four-star hotels,” said Jenrick, adding that the barge in Dorset has been used for oil and gas workers, and citing the use of similar vessels for Ukrainian refugees in Glasgow and Edinburgh. “If it’s good enough for all those people, then it should be good enough for the migrants,” he said. “And we accept it is.” Jenrick also defended the Conservative party deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, who was repirted as saying on Tuesday that anyone who refused to be housed on the Bibby Stockholm “could fuck off back to France”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So if it is good enough for all those people then it should be good enough for the migrants.” However the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, told the same programme that the Conservatives were “promoting division” and “lashing out” due to their own failures on tackling unlawful migration and the asylum backlog. “It is clearly the wrong language to use and it is ramping up the rhetoric as a distraction from the fact the government is failing,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/09/uk-asylum-seekers-who-refuse-to-live-on-barges-could-lose-government-support-bibby-stockholm,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/09/uk-asylum-seekers-who-refuse-to-live-on-barges-could-lose-government-support-bibby-stockholm

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER {{ /VERIFYERRORS }} MPS WHO CAME UP WITH A BLUEPRINT FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS ARRIVING LAWFULLY INTO THE UK HAVE INSISTED THEY ARE LOYAL TO PRIME MINISTER RISHI SUNAK. The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said levels of migration were “too high” and “unsustainable”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-lee-anderson-prime-minister-b2368581.html

Speaking to the BBC, he said he had to look after taxpayers and his duty was to the British public over migrants. He added it was ""fair and reasonable"" to ask asylum seekers to share rooms in hotels in some circumstances. It follows a dispute with asylum seekers over their temporary accommodation in central London. Last week, about 40 asylum seekers were offered space in a Pimlico hotel, but refused to enter after being asked to sleep four people per room. Head of Westminster Council Adam Huq expressed his concern in a letter to the home secretary, saying people who ""are likely to have been through significant and traumatic events"" were being asked to share ""an inappropriately sized room with multiple strangers"". Asked about the case on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Jenrick said the government did not want to use hotels, arguing it was ""taking away valuable assets for the local business community... people's weddings and personal events have had to be cancelled"". ""But where we are using them, it's right that we get good value for money for the taxpayer,"" he added. ""And so if single adult males can share a room, and it's legal to do so, which will obviously depend on the size of the accommodation, then we'll ask people to do that,"" he added. However, he denied it was government policy for asylum seekers and migrants to be housed in shared rooms. He also said the UK's asylum system was ""riddled with abuse"" and that the country could not be allowed to be ""perceived as a soft touch"". Labour said in response: ""After 13 years of Tory failure, the asylum system isn't just broken - it's costing tax payers a fortune - only Labour has a proper plan to stop dangerous boat crossings."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made reducing the numbers coming to the UK illegally one of his key priorities. Part of his plan is to implement the Illegal Migration Bill, currently going through Parliament. It would give ministers new powers to remove anyone arriving in the UK illegally and stop them claiming asylum here. But it has attracted fierce criticism including from the Archbishop of Canterbury, who said it risked ""great damage"" to the UK's reputation. The BBC understands the Home Office estimates the plans in the bill could cost between £3bn and £6bn through spending on detention facilities, as well as ongoing accommodation and removals. Last year the number of people arriving in the UK in small boats via the English Channel hit over 45,000 - the highest number since figures were first collected in 2018. The government is trying different ways to accommodate the rising numbers of people who are coming to the UK, including housing people in barges or facilities on air bases. Mr Jenrick was keen to repeat his assertion that the government is taking a robust approach, and that by asking migrants to share rooms he wants to cut the costs to the taxpayer. BUT HE WAS LESS KEEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BACKLOG FOR ASYLUM CLAIMS IS EXTREMELY HIGH, AND THAT COMPARED TO A FEW YEARS AGO, IT TAKES MUCH LONGER FOR CASES TO BE RESOLVED. The problems with accommodation at 395 hotels around the country would be far less acute if there were fewer people stuck in the system. When it comes to how ministers handle the issues there are not many easy answers.

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER {{ /VERIFYERRORS }} HOME SECRETARY SUELLA BRAVERMAN’S PLANS TO USE CRUISE SHIPS TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE IN TROUBLE AFTER THE VESSELS WERE TURNED DOWN BY DOCKING SITES, IT HAS EMERGED. It comes as the Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge – part of the government’s plan to crackdown on illegal arrivals –was met by protesters as it arrived into Dorset’s Portland Port. Rishi Sunak announced last month that two more vessels would be used for accommodation as part of efforts to deter small boats and reduce the £6m daily cost of hotel accommodation. But plans for one of the boats to house migrants near Liverpool have been scrapped after being declined by the port operator while another vessel was refused docking near Edinburgh, according to Sky News. No 10 did not deny the report, saying the government was still in talks to “open more” accommodation sites at docks elsewhere in Britain. The prime minister’s spokesman told reporters: “We are continuing discussions both in terms of those who can provide additional accommodation facilities and sites where it can be housed.” It is not yet clear how much the Sunak government paid for the two cruise ships before they were returned to the owner. The Home Office said it would not comment on arrangements with vessel owners, saying officials had been looking at a “range of accommodation options which offer better value for the British taxpayer than expensive hotels”. A spokesperson added: “This is why we will be using alternative accommodation options, such as barges, which are more manageable for communities, as our European neighbours are doing.” Protesters in Portland in Dorset after the Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge arrived (Ben Birchall/PA) (PA Wire) Labour’s shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the latest development showed the “incompetence of this Conservative government knows no limits”. Mr Kinnock said the backlog of asylum cases had grown nine-fold under the Tory government, pushing the costs to £3.6bn. “They are now shifting to yet another plan that hasn’t been thought through – spending money on boats that have nowhere to dock.” Asylum seekers are not expected to arrive onboard Bibby Stockholm for at least another week as further work is done to make it suitable for habitation. The Independent understands the vessel must be connected to the Portland Port’s fresh water, mains sewage network and other services, after this it will undergo more tests. An official brochure showed there were only 222 “single en-suite bedrooms” – meaning that at least two people will have to be crammed into every cabin for the government to achieve its claimed capacity. Protests at Portland came as the government hailed the passage of the Illegal Migration Bill, aimed at making sure detained people are promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda – still the subject of a legal challenge. UN human rights chief Volker Turk and UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi led outrage at the plans – saying it could violate international law. “This new legislation significantly erodes the legal framework that has protected so many, exposing refugees to grave risks in breach of international law.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/asylum-cruise-ship-barge-suella-braverman-b2377965.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230829195911/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/asylum-cruise-ship-barge-suella-braverman-b2377965.html

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. This week, Suella Braverman told parliament’s Home Affairs Committee she could not predict the cost of the new Illegal Migration Bill, because there are “many unknown factors”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “THE TORIES ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE TAXPAYERS MONEY ON THEIR TOTAL FAILURE TO FIX THE ASYLUM BACKLOG THEY HAVE CREATED,” SHE ADDED. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" from crossing the English Channel as one of his five pledges after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of hundreds of migrants in hotels after record numbers arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. The opposition Labour Party said Sunak had failed to clear the backlog of tens of thousands of asylum claims and that 7,600 people had crossed the English Channel so far this year - a total that is likely to increase over the summer months. Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving and a toughening of the country's stance on immigration can produce results. He said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country and that London was increasing its provision of accommodation for those awaiting immigration decisions. HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT HAD SECURED TWO NEW VESSELS TO HOUSE MIGRANTS TO MOVE THEM OUT OF HOTELS. Sunak said so far this year, ""the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%"" and that Britain was now accepting one in 50 Albanian asylum cases compared with one in five previously. He urged parliament to pass his new Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for the swift detention and deportation of people arriving on small boats back to their homeland or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda. It is now in the upper house of parliament, where peers could try to weaken some its provisions. ""This won't be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it's so important that we change the law,"" he said. ""My policy is very simple: it is this country - and your government - who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. I will do what is necessary to achieve it. I said I would stop the boats and I meant it.""

Figures released by immigration minister Robert Jenrick showed £1.3 million has been spent on legal costs by the Home Office up to March this year. IN A LETTER TO THE COMMONS' HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE, HE SAID: 'THIS RELATES TO THE JUDICIAL REVIEW AND OVER A HUNDRED DIFFERENT CASES WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS AND GROUPS. 'As legal cases are ongoing and final spend cannot yet be determined, further costs may be released in due course.' The true figure will already be far higher, as the £1.3million sum does not include costs associated with a four-day hearing in the Court of Appeal at the end of April. Defending the Government's Rwanda asylum deal against legal challenges has already cost the British taxpayer more than £1million.

Pictured: Suella Braverman in Rwanda in March On top of its legal fees the Home Office has spent £140million on the Rwanda scheme, even though it remains in legal limbo. A judicial review was launched by the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union and three pro-migrant charities last year. In December the High Court ruled in favour of Home Secretary Suella Braverman and declared the policy lawful. Judges questioned whether the PCS and the charities had even been eligible to intervene against the Rwanda scheme - which will see small boat migrants handed a one-way ticket to the east African nation to claim asylum there rather than here. The judges' ruling said PCS members were 'not directly affected by the Rwanda policy in any sense relevant for the purposes of bringing a claim for judicial review'. However, the union and the charities launched a further attempt to have the policy declared unlawful at the Court of Appeal, with a ruling still pending. Scores of legal challenges have also been brought by individual migrants. Separately, it emerged the Home Office's modern slavery unit is to hire 200 more caseworkers amid record levels of claims under human trafficking laws. MPs were told by Home Office officials the new recruits will aim to speed up decision-making with average waits currently at 560 days.

The head of the Home Office unit which oversees modern slavery claims, Siobhan Jolliffe, told the home affairs committee their recruitment drive will compete with a separate Home Office attempt to hire hundreds more asylum caseworkers. Figures published in March showed a record 17,000 modern slavery claims in 2022, up 33 per cent year on year. The rise was fuelled by a surge in small boat crossings which reached more than 45,700 last year, a record high. Albanians made up the largest nationality claiming they had been trafficked, with 4,613 cases in the year. During April's Court of Appeal hearing on Rwanda, the United Nations refugee agency scheme claimed the scheme is 'incompatible with the UK's fundamental obligations under the Refugee Convention'. Lawyers for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said it 'maintains its unequivocal position that there should be no transfer of asylum-seekers to Rwanda'. However, the UNHCR itself sends refugees to Rwanda, opening it to accusations of 'hypocrisy' from UK government sources. The Geneva-based UNHCR has signed a new agreement to transport migrants from Libya to Rwanda, part-funded by the European Union, until at least 2026. It has already relocated 1,600 asylum seekers from Libya to Rwanda between 2019 and March this year. A key difference between the UNHCR and the Home Office schemes is that the UN's version is voluntary, while Channel migrants will be compelled to go under the UK programme. The PCS, which represents thousands of Home Office workers, last month warned it could ballot for industrial action if it loses the ongoing legal challenge against the Rwanda scheme. The tactics will be seen as the latest example of the Left-leaning cabal within the civil service - dubbed 'the Blob' - attempting to block government policy. A Home Office source has previously condemned the PCS as a 'bunch of activists'.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12220503/Home-Office-spends-1-3m-defending-Rwanda-asylum-deal-amid-legal-battle-scheme-remains-limbo.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12220503/Home-Office-spends-1-3m-defending-Rwanda-asylum-deal-amid-legal-battle-scheme-remains-limbo.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

The Labour MP added: “We will be forced to use these contingency measures because of the mess the Government has made. “I’m confident that within six months of a Labour government we will be getting on top of the backlog and clearing people out of hotels and putting them into suitable accommodation, or removing them from the country properly because they have no right to be here.” The Bibby Stockholm in Portland Port, Dorset, is the first barge the Government has procured to house asylum seekers while their claims are processed.

His promises included a vow to “end indefinite detention and call for the closure of centres such as Yarl’s Wood”. Yarl’s Wood is an immigration detention centre in Bedford where migrants are held before they are deported. But The Sun on Sunday understands that Sir Keir is now binning the policy. Instead, Labour will go into the next election vowing to get the ­massive asylum backlog down and to improve conditions in centres. Tory bosses said yesterday the reversal of the policy is yet more evidence that Sir Keir cannot be trusted to stick to his promises. Tory MP Tom Hunt said: “Sir Flippy Floppy can’t hide the truth. It’s all there for us to see. “Not just in his pledges before becoming leader but in his voting record in Parliament. He’s soft on illegal immigration and has always voted against any attempt to control our borders. “The sheer scale and frequency of his U-turns has got to the point where it’s almost pointless taking seriously anything he says or any position he adopts as it’s highly likely to change within weeks. He’s devoid of principle and a backbone.” It ends a humiliating week for Sir Keir in which he was forced to rip up his green economic plan. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves was sent out on Friday to reveal she was watering down their promise to plough a whopping £28billion a year into eco infrastructure projects. Admitting the splurge risked sending markets into a tailspin, she said Labour will start lower and “ramp up” spending to hit the annual target in about 2027 if they are elected. It was a blow for Ed Miliband, Labour’s former leader and current shadow energy secretary, who masterminded the policy. Ms Reeves said it would be “foolish” to go on the borrowing binge now, which risked interest rates and with it, mortgages. But she blamed the Tories for crashing the economy.

Graham King, 56, ran a caravan park, a taxi firm and a teenage disco a quarter of a century ago, but has since won Home Office contracts to provide accommodation for ever-growing numbers of refugees. His company, Clearsprings Ready Homes, holds the exclusive contracts to house asylum seekers across southern England and Wales. Its annual takings from the Home Office, funded from the foreign aid budget, rocketed to an astonishing £500million in 2021. Mr King’s personal share of the pre-tax profits then was well over £25million, meaning he got more of Britain’s international aid than struggling former colony Ghana, which has a population of 32million. Graham King, 56, ran a caravan park, a taxi firm and a teenage disco a quarter of a century ago, but has since won Home Office contracts to provide accommodation for ever-growing numbers of refugees Mr King's company, Clearsprings Ready Homes, holds the exclusive contracts to house asylum seekers across southern England and Wales Migrants have complained about standards in his hotels, people living nearby have campaigned against their new neighbours, and taxpayers are angered by the rising cost. But asylum tycoon Mr King not only enjoys luxury holidays all over the world but has put his son and daughter through a £44,000-a-year boarding school and bought a listed mansion in rural Essex. Family social media posts reference trips to India, Barbados, Costa Rica, the French Riviera, skiing in the Alps, Berlin, Paris, and Majorca – to name but a selection in the past few years. Meanwhile, Mr King is also funding his daughter’s bid to become an artist. Her artworks feature test tubes full of her own urine and £10 prints bearing the slogan ‘Will trade racists for refugees’, with half the proceeds going to Amnesty International. His daughter, 22, an art student at Reading University, has declared: ‘War, violence and persecution have forced millions of families to seek a safer place to live. When they arrive to safer ground, they’re often met with hostility.’ She does not note that thousands of those same refugees are also helping to keep her father, to whom she affectionately refers as ‘u legend’, in business. Graham King 's daughter Catalina 22, an art student at Reading university Catalina, an art student at reading University, has spoken out to defend refugees, posting on Instagram that many are fleeing war and oppression Accountants working for Mr King’s company predict income will stay booming for years, with the Home Office contract running till 2029 and no sign of migrant numbers dropping. Indeed, last year Home Office spending on housing asylum seekers almost quadrupled, to £3.7billion, meaning Mr King could have made £100million. Today the Daily Mail pictures the migrant tycoon for the first time and tells how he rose to become the asylum hotel King. In the 1990s, he and his brother Jeff were setting out in business on their own after helping their father Jack run his holiday chalets business empire based on Canvey Island in Essex. The King brothers jointly owned the Kings Holiday Camp and Thorney Bay caravan park, plus Steve’s Radio Cars on Canvey Island. In 1999 they made an abortive bid to run an under-18s disco in the Coliseum cinema in Leigh, Essex, before complaints of teenagers vandalising cars, and vomiting in the streets led to Southend council withdrawing its entertainments licence. Then, as the new millennium dawned, the King brothers started winning Government contracts. Mr King (pictured with daughter Catalina) started running small businesses in Essex and is now a tycoon, handling a Home Office contract to house migrants worth £25million a year Mr King is also funding his daughter’s bid to become an artist. Her artworks feature test tubes full of her own urine and £10 prints bearing the slogan ‘Will trade racists for refugees’, with half the proceeds going to Amnesty International Accountants working for Mr King’s company predict income will stay booming for years, with the Home Office contract running till 2029 and no sign of migrant numbers dropping In 1999 Tony Blair’s Labour Government began dispersing asylum seekers round Britain and outsourcing accommodation to private firms. Clearsprings got its first migrant contracts in 2000 – and within months Lord Greaves had told parliament that Clearsprings was among firms ‘profiteering’ from asylum seekers. Mr King – who bought out his brother Jeff from the asylum business three years ago – last year sold shares back to his own company for £70million. And according to his accountants, money will keep pouring into the coffers of Clearsprings, with Mr King still owning 94 per cent of the shares. Accounts note that in the year to January 2022, income from the Home Office trebled to £500million – and before tax profit rocketed by 1,000 per cent to £27.3million, with more than £50million in the bank. The accountants say: ‘The Home Office contracts run until September 2029. Demand for accommodation for asylum seekers has remained high throughout the year. ‘This has been driven by an ever-increasing influx of asylum applicants to the UK due to high levels of political and economic turmoil in many countries. ‘The number of arrivals per year is expected to continue at a high level for the foreseeable future.’ As a result, Mr King’s massive profits are almost certain to keep growing, regardless of a long series of controversies over the migrant accommodation provided. They include claims his firm is depleting the rental market by bidding over the odds to secure properties, changing the character of towns and villages by suddenly introducing huge volumes of refugees, and depriving communities of much-loved hotels – which can also slash income from tourists with nowhere to go. Migrants have complained too, with claims that inadequate action was taken against outbreaks of scabies. There have been complaints of inadequate heating and water after a fire broke out, of migrants having to wear ‘stigmatising’ wrist bands to collect food, of rats, and of poor quality food and broken electrical sockets. Regardless of the controversies, when the Home Office issued its ten-year Asylum Accommodation and Support Contracts in 2019, Mr King’s Clearsprings was one of the big winners. It got guarantees of funding to provide all migrant housing in southern England and Wales, while Serco and Mears cover the rest of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Rather than owning the properties involved, Clearsprings rents them long-term from a multitude of different landlords. It then subcontracts to other firms to feed residents and help them access services including GPs. The Home Office says details of migrant accommodation contracts are confidential for commercial reasons, but they have been estimated to cost the taxpayer an average of £117.64 per migrant every day. Earlier this year Home Office data suggested Clearsprings, Serco and Mears had taken in total taken over 363 hotels in England, 20 in Northern Ireland, ten in Scotland, and two in Wales. The Government’s Bibby Stockholm giant barge now docked off Portland in Dorset had begun to admit a trickle of migrants this week, amid legal challenges and objections, in a bid to cut accommodation costs. Last night it lay empty after they were evacuated following the discovery of Legionella bacteria in the water system. But there are unlikely ever to be enough barges, or berths for them, to take more than a small fraction, and the Government’s plan to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda has stalled legally.

Officials are seeking contractors to run three immigration removal centres (IRCs) amid the “unprecedented rise of small boat crossings”. A contract published by the Home Office states: “Due to the unprecedented rise of small boat crossings in recent years, demand on the IRC estate has increased and there is a requirement for the expansion of its capacity. “This notice covers the procurement of operational services for an additional circa 1,000 detention spaces across three sites. Alternative accommodation solutions are also being explored and, if approved, may lead to further demand for operational services.” The potential locations of the new IRCs is not known. Two of the contracts are for centres to hold 360 channel migrants each at a cost of £108m, while a third would house 300 and cost £90m, the Daily Mail reported. A Home Office spokesman said: “We are committed to the removal of foreign criminals and those with no right to be in the UK. “Immigration removal centres play a vital role in controlling our borders and we have been finding further solutions to scale up our detention capacity.” Up to 10 unused student accommodation and former office blocks are also reportedly under consideration, averaging about 500 places per site, as the government scrambles to get migrants out of hotels. The planned IRCs emerged just days after Rishi Sunak’s plans to house asylum seekers were plunged into chaos after the forced evacuation of the Bibby Stockholm barge. DESPITE THE CHAOS, MR SUNAK AND HOME SECRETARY SUELLA BRAVERMAN ARE PUSHING ON WITH PLANS TO HOUSE MIGRANTS ON BARGES AS WELL AS THE NEW IRCS. All 39 people on the Bibby Stockholm were taken off due to Legionella bacteria. The planned IRCs are part of Mr Sunak’s key pledge to “stop the boats” crossing the English channel. As part of his plans, the government has passed laws allowing migrants who arrive on small boats to be “detained and swiftly returned” to their home country or other countries such as Rwanda. But ongoing small boat crossings mean the UK needs to increase the capacity of its detention centres. Figures show 16,790 migrants have arrived in small boats since January 1, with that number expected to increase amid a spell of good weather on England’s south coast.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/suella-braverman-rishi-sunak-small-boats-b2396468.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20240502170012/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/suella-braverman-rishi-sunak-small-boats-b2396468.html

However, more needs to be done to support the Albanian victims of people smuggling, especially women, the Home Affairs Select Committee said. In a report published on Monday focusing on Albania, the committee said there was no clear basis for the UK to accept thousands of asylum applications from Albanian citizens. It comes after migration data revealed more than a quarter of the 45,755 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2022 were Albanian, most of whom made an asylum claim. The number of Albanians making the channel crossing in small boats rose from 800 in 2021 to 12,301 last year. LABOUR CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE DAME DIANA JOHNSON MP SAID: “SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL SUDDEN INCREASE IN ASYLUM CLAIMS FROM A SEEMINGLY PEACEFUL COUNTRY UNDERSTANDABLY RAISED CONCERNS. Read more: Boris's Trump problem means Johnson-Farage Brexit 'dream team' will never happen The Home Affairs Select Committee has said there must be more support to Albanian smuggling victims “While it is important that questions are asked and lessons are learnt, it is clear that the immigration picture is not static and will continue to evolve. “New challenges are likely to continue to emerge and it is important that the UK improves its overall approach to asylum, rather than focus on one country.” The committee said the main driver of migration from Albania was economic and recommended the Government promote seasonal work visas in agriculture and construction to give more Albanians the opportunity to come to the UK without making unauthorised channel crossings. The committee also said that while claims for political asylum “should not normally be entertained”, there are “unquestionably cases of Albanian citizens being trafficked to the UK”. It said appropriate safeguards must be in place before any victims of trafficking are returned to Albania and also recommended the UK maintain strong links with the country’s government.

The justice secretary has said he would be comfortable with severe punishment for immigration lawyers who engage in malpractice after the government said they could face life in jail under the terms of the Illegal Migration Act. But a senior official from the Law Society, the body that represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed out that a government taskforce being trumpeted by ministers on Tuesday in response to allegations of wrongdoing by some solicitors in dealing with asylum applications had already been working for months before the scandal. “The solicitors’ profession wants to see all of this eradicated. It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring, said David McNeill, the Law Society’s director of public affairs. McNeill spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after three legal firms were shut down over allegations false asylum claims were being submitted for a fee. He accepted such practice could go on in the industry but said: “This taskforce which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels – 50,000.” The government’s approach to dealing with asylum claims has included requiring people to submit a claim while physically in the UK, while also shutting off all safe and legal routes to get there to the vast majority of people. Campaigners have argued this has pushed people to try to enter by irregular means, such as by crossing the Channel in small boats. ON TUESDAY, THE JUSTICE SECRETARY, ALEX CHALK, TOLD GB NEWS: “THERE’S BEEN LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR THOSE WHO AID AND ABET ILLEGAL MIGRATION FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND, YES, I’M ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE THAT THOSE WHO BREACH THEIR PROFESSIONAL DUTIES AND ACT ILLEGALLY SHOULD BE CONVICTED, PUNISHED AND DISGRACED. I’m entirely comfortable with that.” Chalk added: “Most lawyers do a fantastic job, but those that don’t, those that abuse their position and act illegally, it’s very important that the system comes down on that like a ton of bricks.” He also said the backlog of cases had decreased by 17,000 over recent weeks, after Home Office figures revealed more than 50,000 people were staying in hotels in June. On Sunday, the Independent reported that thousands of cases had simply been marked as cleared without the claimant having been assessed. The news site reported that Home Office guidance allowed officials to unilaterally close cases, even where they had not been able to contact the claimant, with a letter to them simply being filed away. It said many were closed because people did not attend interviews, quoting a Home Office official as saying: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down. A lot of interviews were booked to withdraw as many claims as possible [if people didn’t turn up].”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/ministers-accused-of-lawyer-bashing-to-distract-from-asylum-policy-failures

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} An Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a £1.6bn contract covering the UK’s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel “beyond what it was intended to be used for”. Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak’s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing £6m a day. THIS WEEK, SUELLA BRAVERMAN TOLD PARLIAMENT’S HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SHE COULD NOT PREDICT THE COST OF THE NEW ILLEGAL MIGRATION BILL, BECAUSE THERE ARE “MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS”. Three vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations. Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public “should know how much is being paid” on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was “alarmingly high”. “The point is this is taxpayers' money,” he told The Independent. “This contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. “Then on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.” Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has “serious questions to answer”. “The Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,” she added. “This is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.” Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at Falmouth The CTM contract, published under the title “provision of bridging accommodation and travel services”, states that it has an estimated value of £1,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025. The Home Office refused to answer The Independent’s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed “pricing details” have been redacted in full because of “commercial interests”. John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: “This murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years. “Ministers must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.” Answering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed “by a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation”. He added that the provider had “managed two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year”. On its website, CTM describes itself as “a global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel”. The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a “two-person start-up into one of the world’s most successful travel management companies”, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has two UK offices in London and Manchester. The official brochure for the Bibby Stockholm shows 222 single bedrooms, but the Home Office says it will house 500 asylum seekers (Bibby Marine) The firm’s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (£160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022. A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract’s “significant impact” on financial growth, adding: “This work involves highly complex services and logistic support … CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.” The government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for “travel and venue solutions”, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants. A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of “pushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for”. “If products and services are outside scope there’s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,” they told The Independent. “It doesn’t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they’ve done it to minimise visibility.” The remit of CTM’s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list over the repatriation of British nationals stranded abroad duringt he Covid pandemic. A report by parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee found that the operation was “too slow and placed too much reliance on commercial providers”, but CTM was then handed a contract for operating quarantine hotels and mandatory testing. In a series of angry Google reviews that dragged the company’s rating down to 1.4 stars, one person called CTM “incompetent”, while another wrote: “Shame on the Tory government UK, on whoever decided to give them this contract.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 / 50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 15 June 2023 Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling PA UK news in pictures 14 June 2023 Grace Kumar’s father and Barnaby Webber’s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 June PA UK news in pictures 13 June 2023 Police forensics officers on Ilkeston Road PA UK news in pictures 12 June 2023 People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in London Reuters UK news in pictures 11 June 2023 Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023 Action Images via Reuters UK news in pictures 10 June 2023 A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, London Reuters UK news in pictures 9 June 2023 A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in London AP UK news in pictures 8 June 2023 A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse Fair PA UK news in pictures 7 June 2023 The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby Club PA UK news in pictures 6 June 2023 An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 5 June 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to Dover PA UK news in pictures 4 June 2023 A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central England AFP via Getty Images UK news in pictures 2 June 2023 Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in Devon PA UK news in pictures 1 June 2023 The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in London PA UK news in pictures 31 May 2023 Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, Belfast PA UK news in pictures 30 May 2023 A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in London AP UK news in pictures 29 May 2023 Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weather PA UK news in pictures 28 May 2023 Great Britain’s Nick Bandurak scores their side’s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men’s match at Lee Valley, London PA UK news in pictures 27 May 2023 People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in London AP UK news in pictures 26 May 2023 People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east London PA UK news in pictures 25 May 2023 King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern Ireland PA UK news in pictures 24 May 2023 Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North Yorkshire PA UK news in pictures 23 May 2023 An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, Britain Reuters UK news in pictures 22 May 2023 Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower Show AP UK news in pictures 21 May 2023 People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PA UK news in pictures 20 May 2023 Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East Sussex PA UK news in pictures 19 May 2023 Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, Berkshire PA UK news in pictures 18 May 2023 Choristers from the Choir of St John’s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol - a custom dating back to 1902.

It is right that we explore all available options. “CTM was awarded the contract to deliver accommodation for the Home Office after an extensive procurement process and has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation. “We are pleased that they will be providing management for Bibby Stockholm, the two additional vessels announced by the prime minister, as well as bridging accommodation and travel services.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20231107205558/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/barge-australia-asylum-contract-travel-b2354578.html

HMT Empire Windrush docked in Britain on June 22, 1948, and marked the beginning of a wave of immigration that helped repair post-war Britain. That generation and their contribution to the UK will be celebrated across the country. What is the Windrush generation? It started with around 500 Caribbeans paying about £28 (£1,040 in today’s money) to travel to Britain in response to job adverts in local newspapers. Having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948, they left a sunnier climate to seek greater opportunities in the UK, which was facing a labour shortage after the Second World War. They exited the vessel on June 22, 1948, having arrived the day before. The thousands who followed from colonies in the West Indies until 1971 became known as the Windrush generation. The 14,651 ton British troopship the Empire Windrush at Southampton / PA Wire Who was on the ship? Jamaicans, Bermudans, and Trinidadians were among those on board. Some had fought for Britain during the war and many would go on to fill roles in the UK — including as cooks, nurses, engineers, carpenters, and mechanics. One passenger was Sam “Mr Windrush” King, who became the first black mayor of Southwark in London and co-founded the Notting Hill Carnival. Another was Lord Woodbine, a calypso musician whose real name was Harold Philips. He would be described as the “sixth Beatle” for his mentorship of the band during their fledgling years. Windrush oral histories clip What about those who followed? Many who pursued the pioneering group on the Windrush went on to be key workers staffing the NHS, which also began its journey in 1948. The generation came to a close with the 1971 Immigration Act, legislation guaranteeing the right of those already settled in the UK to remain indefinitely. After that, a British passport-holder born overseas could only reside in the UK if they had a work permit and could also prove they had a parent or grandparent born in the UK.

In 2018, it emerged that some from the Windrush generation were facing deportation and being denied access to healthcare, work, housing benefits, and pensions. They had the legal right to reside in the UK, but could not necessarily prove they had been in the country near-continuously, as new laws demand. Windrush Portrait of a Generation Many believed they had an automatic right to citizenship so had not got the paperwork. Some had arrived as children on a parent’s passport and officials admitted thousands of landing card slips recording their entry had been destroyed, eliminating vital evidence. How did the Government respond? THEN HOME SECRETARY SAJID JAVID, WHO TOOK A SOFTER APPROACH / JOE GIDDENS/PA WIRE THEN PRIME MINISTER, THERESA MAY SAID SHE WAS “GENUINELY SORRY” FOR THE ANXIETY CAUSED. Amber Rudd was forced out as home secretary and replaced by Sajid Javid, who vowed to ensure those caught up would be treated with “decency and fairness” and signalled a softer approach to immigration policy. The Government went on to announce an annual Windrush Day to “recognise and honour the enormous contribution” of those who disembarked at Tilbury 70 years earlier. How will the 75th anniversary be celebrated? A group known as the Windrush 75 network has committed to making it an entire year of marking the anniversary. They say: “The 75th anniversary of the Windrush arriving in the UK is a Diamond Jubilee for modern, diverse Britain – when we mark an important moment in British history and come together to celebrate four generations of contribution, legacy, struggle, and positive change.” A host of events are being planned, including question and answer sessions with people and their families who came over, art installations, and dance events. The full list of events can be found here. What events are taking place in London? A photograph exhibition entitled Journeys to Hope started in January and finishes in September at Rivington Place near Farringdon. The outside exhibition can be seen at any time and is free, showing the journeys from an array of historic snapshots in time. Lenny Henry is also putting on a one-man show in his playwriting debut at the Bush Theatre near Kensington. Entitled August in England, it tells the story of a Windrush worker. The play finishes on June 10, and there are still some limited tickets available here. Trevor Nelson will also host a night of music at the Royal Albert Hall this Friday (June 9), at the Royal Albert Hall Presents Windrush 75 event. This one-off concert will feature an array of guest stars, including Craig David, Beverley Knight, R&B group Loose Ends, saxophonist YolanDa Brown, and more.

Jenrick also deflected questions on Sunday about how many people had been removed from the UK under a “gold standard” UK-Albanian deal, which targets people arriving illegally from Albania mainly by crossing the Channel. He said hundreds of people had been removed but that others were still being housed in hotels or had absconded. Jenrick told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday show it was still “early days” under the deal and that “spurious last minute claims” had held up deportations. The deal with the Albanian authorities had been lauded by Rishi Sunak as the prime minister came under pressure from the right of the Tory party after figures showed more than a third of people who arrived on small boats in the UK via the Channel in the first nine months of 2022 were from Albania. While Jenrick initially said thousands had been removed to Albania, he went on to qualify this by saying: “There are hundreds of Albanians who’ve arrived on small boats who have been placed on those flights as a result of the processes we put in place and the agreements that we’ve reached with Albania.” The government is under renewed pressure from its own backbenches after figures published last month showed net immigration to the UK had increased from 488,000 in 2021 to 606,000 in 2022. The figure for last year is nearly double the number in 2018. Jenrick told the BBC that net immigration was “far too high today”. But when asked about a pledge under David Cameron to limit immigration to “tens of thousands” of people a year, Jenrick said: “I don’t think that targets like that are particularly helpful because migration is an extremely challenging space where behaviours are constantly changing.” He said a lot of progress had been made on illegal immigration in a short period of time, with “really unique landmark deals” with France resulting in a “big increase” in the number of interceptions on the beaches. But Jenrick said the asylum system, which, according to him had a backlog of more than 150,000 cases, must be changed “fundamentally”. He said the illegal migration bill would alleviate the pressure. The government’s asylum bill – which is supposed to change the law so that those who arrive in the UK by irregular means can be removed to a third country such as Rwanda – goes before the House of Lords this week. It is expected to face significant opposition from peers and could be amended or delayed until later in the year. Defending the government’s record during a round of broadcast interviews on Sunday, Jenrick said a lot of progress had been made on illegal immigration in a short period of time. But he told the BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “The asylum system is riddled with abuse, we have to be honest with ourselves.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guardian Headlines UK Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These are single adult males: I don’t think that’s unreasonable,” he said, adding that the government wanted to reduce the cost to the taxpayer.

The official figures show the number of people arriving in the UK in small boats since 2018 has topped 100,000, an arbitrary figure but one that has caused much Conservative ire. Chief among those critics was the party’s deputy chair, Lee Anderson. The MP for Leigh said the government was failing on immigration. He was “very angry about the number. AGAIN, VERY ANGRY, AS YOU KNOW, EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN I SEE THESE ILLEGAL MIGRANTS,” HE TOLD GB NEWS, REPEATING HIS CLAIM THAT PEOPLE ARRIVING ON SMALL BOATS WERE NOT GENUINE ASYLUM SEEKERS. In fact, a look at the latest Home Office figures shows a majority of people arriving on small boats are genuine. In the year to the end of March, 90% of small boat arrivals claimed asylum. Due to a large backlog at the Home Office, most of these have not been processed – but of those that have, 60% had their application granted. The government’s tendency to focus almost exclusively on small boat arrivals means there has been a lack of wider context from the discussion about irregular immigration in the UK. For example, despite the anger at breaching the 100,000 figure, the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats has fallen relative to this point in 2022. Official figures from the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office show 18,674 people had arrived by small boat as of 10 August last year. This year the figure is 15% lower. There is also an international context: the UK is far from the only country that has to deal with irregular migration by sea. UN refugee agency figures show that Italy – a country with a comparable population – had 90,484 people arrive in small boats as of 6 August – six times as many as the UK, and more than double last year’s figure. Spain (with a population of 47 million compared with the UK’s 67 million) also received more unauthorised sea arrivals between January and July this year (16,573 – up 3.8% on 2022, and 1,841 more than the UK). Greece managed to reduce the number of unauthorised sea arrivals from a peak of nearly 857,000 in 2015 during the EU migrant crisis to just over 4,300 in 2021 – but figures have also risen since. At the end of July 8,867 people had crossed to Greece by boat – up 137% from the same period last year. This rise in small boat crossings to mainland Europe is also leading to a tragic rise in the number of people drowning. International Organization for Migration records show 2,062 dead or missing migrants in the Mediterranean between January and July this year – the highest number since 2017. If the UK government wants to reduce its asylum caseload, tackling small boat crossings will only do so much. Home Office figures show that while most people who cross in small boats are genuine asylum seekers, most people seeking asylum generally have not arrived in a small boat. Since 2020, 47% of applications have been from people in small boats, and while some periods have had higher figures, in the first three months of this year small boat arrivals made up just 28% of UK asylum applications. This is neatly illustrated by the fact that most asylum seekers so far selected to be housed on the Bibby Stockholm barge are not actually small boat migrants (most used regular passenger planes to reach the UK) – which begs the question of how much the government’s “small boats week” is actually about small boats at all.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/11/small-boats-week-ignores-wider-context-irregular-immigration-uk,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/11/small-boats-week-ignores-wider-context-irregular-immigration-uk

The New Conservatives group, made up of Tory MPs from the 2017 and 2019 intake, said British employers had become “addicted” to cheap foreign labour as they argued it was time to “turn off the taps” of low-skilled workers arriving from abroad. IPSWICH MP TOM HUNT SAID LEVELS OF MIGRATION WERE “TOO HIGH” AND “UNSUSTAINABLE”. The backbencher is the author of a report for the New Conservatives which recommends that ministers close temporary visa schemes for care workers and cap the number of refugees resettling in the UK at 20,000. But despite acknowledging that he thought the UK Government could go “further” to tackle legal net migration — which stood at 606,000 last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics — Mr Hunt denied that the group was looking to “undermine” Mr Sunak. During a central London press briefing on Monday, MPs from the group regularly pointed back to the Tory 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, arguing that their plan was about helping ministers achieve that aim ahead of next year’s likely general election. Mr Hunt told reporters in Westminster: “I know there is a lot being written about ‘Tory rebels’ et cetera. I think particularly on illegal migration (Rishi Sunak) has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I’ll just make it absolutely clear, that is not how we see it. I supported Rishi Sunak to become Prime Minister, I do not regret the decision I made. “I think particularly on illegal migration he has been incredibly brave with the policies he has adopted, particularly in relation to the Illegal Migration Bill and his continued support for the Rwanda policy.” Mr Hunt said it was his and his colleagues’ experience of speaking to voters that had convinced them to speak out on net migration levels. After praising the impact migration had had on his Suffolk constituency, the backbencher said: “I think recently though, the level and the scale of migration has been too high, it has been unsustainable. It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year Conservative MP Tom Hunt “I think it is wrong to brand people who have concerns about net migration being at the level it is right now as somehow hostile to immigration, when it is absolutely not the case. “It is disparaging to label people as xenophobes for having concerns about having net migration at half-a-million a year.” Mr Hunt said net migration would likely fall next year as they would not include Ukrainian refugee numbers and those resettled from Hong Kong, but added: “But naturally, we believe that there is slightly further to go.” Lee Anderson, vice chairman of the Conservative Party, had initially been due to speak at Monday’s press conference but Danny Kruger, MP for Devizes, said he was too ill attend. His name did not appear on a list of 20 Tory MPs officially backing Mr Hunt’s report, The New Conservatives’ Plan To Cut Migration, but Mr Kruger insisted Mr Anderson remained “very supportive”. Addressing Mr Anderson’s absence, Mr Kruger said: “He’s a vice chairman of the party so he doesn’t officially endorse policy proposals to the party, understandably. “But he is very much part of our group, very supportive of what we are doing and said so publicly, so he is very much on board with what we are doing.” Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said only when the supply of cheap labour was scaled back would Britons be able to gain better skills. We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don't turn off the taps to mass legal migration Conservative MP Miriam Cates She said that without reforms “we’re not going to stop the addiction to cheap labour”. “We’ve got stagnant wages, stagnant productivity, we’ve got really difficult labour market conditions because of years and years of not investing in our own people,” she said. “We are never going to realise the value of our own workers and upskill our own workers if we don’t turn off the taps to mass legal migration.” Ms Cates questioned the decision to keep care workers on the occupation shortage list, a designation that allows the sector to bring lower-skilled workers into the country to fill positions, suggesting it was a Covid policy that had not delivered. She said the country had “record levels of migration, and we’ve still not solved the care crisis”, with Ms Cates instead arguing that the solution was to “train up our own people to do the work” and “improve the pay conditions so that people want to do it”. Mr Kruger said the group, along with his party, were rallying against the “establishment” when it came to migration reforms. “There is an establishment in this country, which the Conservative leadership and our colleagues here are not part of, and that is the establishment that we’re fighting against, that resists these proposals, particularly on immigration,” he said. Downing Street said the Government had no plan to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list and downplayed the prospect of blocking foreign university students from staying in the UK after graduation – another recommendation made by the New Conservatives group. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to say whether Mr Sunak was frustrated by Mr Anderson’s support for tougher migration rules but acknowledged there were “different views on each side”. Home Secretary Suella Braverman faced a question from Tory MP James Daly in the Commons about raising the main skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 per annum, a recommendation made in Mr Hunt’s report. Mrs Braverman told him she recognised that “net migration is too high” and that overall numbers needed to be reduced. She earlier told MPs: “We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-prime-minister-lee-anderson-b2368581.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20230712025821/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tom-hunt-conservatives-mps-prime-minister-lee-anderson-b2368581.html

Picture date: Monday June 5, 2023. Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS        LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday his plan to stop migrants arriving in small boats had reduced crossings by 20%, an update he hopes will ease criticism from his party and in the country over immigration policy. Sunak, who is expected to lead his governing Conservative Party into a national election next year, has promised to ""stop the boats"" from crossing the English Channel as one of his five pledges after he was propelled to power in October last year. But he has been criticised by members of his own party and the public for not moving quickly enough, with people protesting about the housing of hundreds of migrants in hotels after record numbers arrived in Britain last year. ""In the five months since I launched the plan, crossings are now down 20% compared to last year,"" Sunak told a news conference in southern England. ""The plan is working,"" he said, adding his government was not complacent and would work hard to make sure parliament passed a new law. The opposition Labour Party said Sunak had failed to clear the backlog of tens of thousands of asylum claims and that 7,600 people had crossed the English Channel so far this year - a total that is likely to increase over the summer months. Britain has long struggled to curb the number of arrivals on its southern shores, but Sunak is keen to show his plan of securing agreements with other European countries to reduce the numbers arriving and a toughening of the country's stance on immigration can produce results. He said a deal with Albania had meant that Britain was returning more migrants to the country and that London was increasing its provision of accommodation for those awaiting immigration decisions. He said the government had secured two new vessels to house migrants to move them out of hotels. SUNAK SAID SO FAR THIS YEAR, ""THE NUMBER OF ALBANIAN SMALL BOAT ARRIVALS HAS FALLEN BY ALMOST 90%"" AND THAT BRITAIN WAS NOW ACCEPTING ONE IN 50 ALBANIAN ASYLUM CASES COMPARED WITH ONE IN FIVE PREVIOUSLY. He urged parliament to pass his new Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for the swift detention and deportation of people arriving on small boats back to their homeland or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda. It is now in the upper house of parliament, where peers could try to weaken some its provisions. ""This won't be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it's so important that we change the law,"" he said. ""My policy is very simple: it is this country - and your government - who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. I will do what is necessary to achieve it. I said I would stop the boats and I meant it.""

The overwhelming majority are hard-working, honest and decent – and want to do the best by their clients. But a small number are none of these things. The lawyers who coached would-be illegal immigrants to concoct fictional back-stories to secure asylum claims are putting a dagger through the heart of our justice system. They shame the profession to which I have devoted much of my life. A FAIR, HONEST AND IMPARTIAL LEGAL SYSTEM IS THE BASIS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. These revelations will shake people's faith in it. While all of us find the actions of career criminals deplorable, it is more shocking to discover that those who we expect to uphold the law are instead helping to perpetrate a fraud upon us all. I am appalled that solicitors and so-called 'legal advisers' should have behaved in such a way. To make matters worse, the cynical practices uncovered by the Mail appear to be widespread. Up to 40 law firms suspected of coaching asylum claimants to present false stories of persecution and oppression are now under investigation.

Encouraging illegal immigrants to get married to a British resident may be an old ruse, but it's still as effective. Handing out anti-depressants to use as 'evidence' of trauma is less well-known, but equally vile. By misleading the court, as these advisers proposed doing, not only are they in breach of their professional duties, but many would be committing criminal offences: namely, perverting the course of public justice, which usually – and rightly – results in an immediate custodial sentence.

Their actions make it harder for those most in need to have their claims fairly heard. It is almost beyond my comprehension that advisers working for firms governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority could instruct applicants on how to make up stories. For the firms that employ these advisors, ignorance should be no defence. The senior solicitors might not themselves have urged claimants to lie, but it is their responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen. There should have been safeguards, such as regular audits, to make sure employees were behaving ethically and lawfully. Their failure should carry severe consequences. One of the great popular myths about the legal profession is the idea that we lawyers treat the truth as something flexible. The question I'm always asked in a black cab is: 'How can you defend a murderer when you know he's guilty?' And the answer is: 'I can't defend him if he tells me he did it. Legally and ethically, it's forbidden.' Every law student learns legal ethics at the very start of their training. It's impossible to gain any qualifications without understanding them. In fact, one of my favourite dictums – and one that I pass on to young people coming into the profession – is: 'Never do anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the Daily Mail.' That's a great rule of thumb to help concentrate the mind on where the grey areas of ethics start. But the alleged behaviour of these lawyers in flouting immigration rules is not in any grey area. If true, it's as bad as any criminal I've prosecuted. If these allegations are proven, these men must be struck off, imprisoned and disgraced. Nothing else will do.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337539/JERRY-HAYES-Mail-uncovers-legal-advisors-coaching-clients-game-lawyers-make-harder-REAL-asylum-seekers-writes-JERRY-HAYES.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12337539/JERRY-HAYES-Mail-uncovers-legal-advisors-coaching-clients-game-lawyers-make-harder-REAL-asylum-seekers-writes-JERRY-HAYES.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

The first group of asylum seekers were moved on to the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland, Dorset, on Monday. Lawyers soon intervened to halt further transfers after claims the 220-bedroom vessel was unsafe and unsuitable for traumatised people. “If you decline the accommodation that’s provided, such as a barge, then we will consider removing your asylum support and that individual will ultimately have to fend for themselves,” Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. The government meets its legal obligations to provide asylum seekers with accommodation and basic needs, said Jenrick, adding that the respective hotels and locations are a “no-choice basis” and not an “a la carte menu”. The announcement is part of Rishi Sunak’s “small boats week”, during which the government is planning a series of eye-catching announcements responding to mounting pressure to remove asylum seekers from hotels. A rising backlog of asylum cases has not yet been processed by the Home Office, and the cost of hotel accommodation soared to £1.9bn last year. “We’re not making anybody destitute,” said Jenrick. “They would be choosing to do so because they wouldn’t accept the perfectly decent accommodation that’s provided.” The use of barges and former military bases to accommodate some asylum seekers has been met with alarm by refugee organisations for being costly, cruel and inhumane. Concerns have also been raised over fire safety, overcrowding and threats from the far right. “We shouldn’t need to be putting people up in four-star hotels,” said Jenrick, adding that the barge in Dorset has been used for oil and gas workers, and citing the use of similar vessels for Ukrainian refugees in Glasgow and Edinburgh. “If it’s good enough for all those people, then it should be good enough for the migrants,” he said. “AND WE ACCEPT IT IS.” JENRICK ALSO DEFENDED THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, LEE ANDERSON, WHO WAS REPIRTED AS SAYING ON TUESDAY THAT ANYONE WHO REFUSED TO BE HOUSED ON THE BIBBY STOCKHOLM “COULD FUCK OFF BACK TO FRANCE”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So if it is good enough for all those people then it should be good enough for the migrants.” However the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, told the same programme that the Conservatives were “promoting division” and “lashing out” due to their own failures on tackling unlawful migration and the asylum backlog. “It is clearly the wrong language to use and it is ramping up the rhetoric as a distraction from the fact the government is failing,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/09/uk-asylum-seekers-who-refuse-to-live-on-barges-could-lose-government-support-bibby-stockholm,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/09/uk-asylum-seekers-who-refuse-to-live-on-barges-could-lose-government-support-bibby-stockholm

Officials told the Commons public accounts committee the government department keeps a “buffer” of about 5,000 beds across the country in case of a sudden influx of Channel crossings in a bid to avoid a repeat of problems at the Manston processing centre in Kent. The move follows legal claims from hundreds of asylum seekers who were illegally held at the centre in November. The cases could result in payouts of millions of pounds. Manston was supposed to hold up to 1,600 people seeking asylum for around 24 hours while they underwent security checks. But conditions quickly deteriorated in the autumn after the numbers rose to 4,000. There were cases of infectious diseases including diphtheria and outbursts of violence. At a public accounts committee hearing on Monday, the second permanent secretary, Simon Ridley, disclosed that 5,000 beds had been reserved by the Home Office in case of a surge in the numbers of people crossing the Channel. When asked how the department was making sure people are processed quickly and within legal time limits on arrival in the UK, Ridley told the committee the Home Office was “making sure we’ve got a buffer that is close to 5,000 beds … so we’re carrying a large number of empty beds in order to let us move people out [of Manston]”. “We have got excess beds that we are paying for that we can move people into immediately,” he said. MPs expressed surprise at the number set aside. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, said: “We have to have a buffer somewhere because if we don’t, we know what happens, we have people for more than 24 hours in Manston. “I hope the committee would support the suggestion of having a buffer.” Home Office data shows that for 20 days between 11 October and 6 November 2022 the numbers on the site exceeded 1,600 – peaking at 3,965 on 30 October 2022. Between 15 August and 23 November last year, more than 18,000 new arrivals were processed through Manston, according to the Home Office. The disclosure of the Home Office’s “buffer” comes a month after David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that civil servants lacked a plan outlining where they would house a surge in asylum seekers at Manston. “Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,” Neal said in a report summary. SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THE HOME SECRETARY, WANTS TO USE BARGES AND SITES INCLUDING CONVERTED MILITARY BASES TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REDUCE THE £6M DAILY COST OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WHILE PEOPLE AWAIT A DECISION ON THEIR STATUS. However, the plans have been beset with delays and legal challenges. The Home Office hopes to stop using hotels “as soon as possible”, Rycroft said, but did not give the committee a target date. He insisted the department was “on track” to meet Rishi Sunak’s target of cutting part of the backlog of asylum cases waiting to be dealt with by the end of the year. Abi Tierney, head of passports, visas and immigration, said the Home Office was “confident” it will have 2,500 caseworkers in post in September in a bid to speed up case decisions. She said around 1,700 asylum decisions are being made by the Home Office per week and it is on track to be making 2,500 decisions a week by the end of July in order to meet the target. Efforts to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Portland, Dorset, have been delayed – five weeks after Braverman promised MPs it would be in place within a fortnight, the Bibby Stockholm vessel was still in Cornwall where it had been undergoing refurbishment work. The government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in the belief that it will deter up to 65,000 asylum seekers every year crossing the Channel in small boats. The policy was rejected by the courts last month. Braverman is challenging the decision in the supreme court.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers,http://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/10/home-office-paying-for-thousands-of-empty-beds-reserved-for-asylum-seekers
